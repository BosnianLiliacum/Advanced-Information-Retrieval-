I googled and people suggested AWS lambda, but I am getting frustrated after having to learn boto3 to save to s3, how to set up a VPC and all these other things just to get internet connectivity and the ability to save, and it's a new toolset, development environment, etc. I have a python script that runs locally fine, I just don't want to have a laptop running it 24/7 and if it goes down to lose a chunk of data (it's an API for transit vehicle tracking). I've made a pythonanywhere account but is there something I'm missing? What's the easiest way to:

* Run a python script 24/7 regardless of my local machine
* Have internet access to make an API call
* Have the ability to save the results of the API call

Is there an easy setup for AWS lambda I'm missing? Or a step-by-step tutorial or something? Or another service that would be easier?

Comment: Get yourself a Raspberry Pi (3B+ up) and run your script there. They are built for 24/7 operation. Easiest and cheapest way. No cloud involved.

Comment: I think whatever guide you're following for lambda is making things way more complicated. You can go to lambda, create a new lambda with your script or compiled executable depending on your language of choice, and then set a schedule in aws eventbridge to invoke it every minute. You don't need to configure a vpc for this.

Comment: There are many ways to do this, but one easy option is to just start an EC2 instance, copy over your Python script, and run it there.  A GCE instance or a VPS would work just as well.

The quick-and-dirty way is to log in with SSH and run it manually, using a `screen` or `tmux` session to keep it running after you log out. A cleaner way is to create a systemd unit file to automatically run the script on boot and restart it if it crashes.
