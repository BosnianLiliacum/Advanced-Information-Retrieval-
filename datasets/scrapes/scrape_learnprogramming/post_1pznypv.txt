I have been learning python,kotlin, C++, HTML, and CSS for a while now and then I decided to go to leetcode. I attempted a few problems and realized I don't know jack shit about programming.

Comment: Perfect. Now you have nowhere to go but up. This was a cathartic feeling when it happened to me many many moons ago.

Once you understand that you know nothing, the real gains begin.

Comment: LC is like a free throw contest, where programming is like playing in a live basketball game. Being good at Free throws isn’t going to make you a good programmer, but it’ll help a tiny bit. And you can brag to people who can’t do either

Comment: You can't do LeetCode without solid DSA foundation and skills.

Also, LeetCode is for interview prep. It will not make you much of a better programmer as it does not bear much resemblance with real world programming.

Much better to make real world projects.

Comment: It could be an idea to stick to one language for a while, to get a solid foundation
