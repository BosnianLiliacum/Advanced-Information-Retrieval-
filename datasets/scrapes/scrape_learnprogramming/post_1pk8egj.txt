I am quite frustrated after my first semester in programming. Sure, my community college is not exactly well rated, but the experience so far has me questioning my career choice, even if I enjoy it a lot.

  
We were asked, after barely 3 months and a week, to almost fully code a website using HTML and CSS (no bootstrap or else), fully from memory, including flex and grid, forms, making everything work responsively. Again, no notes, no documentation, no references.

  
Is that how it is on the job market? Am I expected to show up, learn stuff real fast, and be treated like a dummy if I consult documentation? I chose this career path partly because I like it, but also because I thought I could consult documentation until it becomes second nature down the line.

Comment: No absolutely not. In the real world, 99.999% of engineers refer to documentation constantly

Comment: You basically don't have to know *anything* by heart. You just have to be able to figure it out in a reasonable time frame to get things done and tested before a deadline.

Comment: I consult docs, my own notes, or quick google searches every day and I also make a point of doing it while sharing my screen during training/pair programming with juniors just to hammer the point home that it's completely normal and no one should be afraid of saying that they don't know something.

On the other hand - it is important to internalize *concepts*, and generally a quick google search wouldn't help you instantly grasp a concept either.

Comment: I have been programming for a living since the late 1980s. Immediately before reading this post, I spent a good 30 minutes looking up a bunch of stuff in order to finish some work I was doing. 

You'll be looking up stuff forever. Don't stress.
