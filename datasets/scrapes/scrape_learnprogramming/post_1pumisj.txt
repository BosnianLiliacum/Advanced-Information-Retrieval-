Hello, everyone. Recently, I wanted to learn about algorithms, but I have no idea where to start. I have a folder with some books on programming, but there is nothing about algorithms except for Knuth.  
This raises two questions: does it make sense for me to read Knuth, and what books can you recommend on the subject of algorithms in general?  
  
P.S.: I think I simply don't have enough knowledge of mathematics for Knuth, because I'm just a regular high school graduate. If I'm wrong, you can convince me otherwise.

Comment: Knuth, as you suspected, is very math heavy and is deep deep into theory. A more approachable text is "A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms" by Jay Wengrow.

Comment: I like Essential Algorithms: A Practical Approach to Computer Algorithms by Rod Stephens. 

Unlike other books he uses pseudo code instead of a programming language. He also has a book about algorithms with C# and Python

Comment: Start with Grokking Algorithms. It's visual, doesn't assume you have a math degree, and actually explains the \*why\* behind things instead of just throwing formulas at you. Knuth is legendary but it's like trying to learn guitar by studying music theory dissertations

Comment: If you want to use Knuth but feel like you need math for it, he literally co-wrote Concrete Mathematics, one of my favorite textbooks, for that exact purpose.

Some are recommending CLRS Introduction to Algorithms, which is great but might also overwhelm. Tom Cormen (the C in CLRS) wrote Algorithms Unlocked to be a non technical first step if that's of interest.
