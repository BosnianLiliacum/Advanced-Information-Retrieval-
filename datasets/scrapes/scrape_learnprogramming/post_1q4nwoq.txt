I was exploring the possibility of building per-tenant databases and came up with the project that people found interesting enough to visit.  
Since lots of the comments were saying that it could be something useful that helps people learn SQL, I thought I might just share it here.

So, [https://sqlnet.cc](https://sqlnet.cc) \- is a Twitter-like social network, where people have to write actual SQL queries to post, like, comment, and follow.

This could be useful for people just starting to learn SQL.  It's boring to learn queries with systematically generated data. or just rewriting queries from the books, StackOverflow.  
  
Here you have real data, produced by real customers, and you can play with it in any way you like. 

You can drop users, posts, and edit them.   
Each user has its own dedicated database instance that syncs with the rest of the network..

If you break things, just create a new account.
