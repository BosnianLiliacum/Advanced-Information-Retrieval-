After all this years learning and giving up, I finally made my first program that does something meaningful! And even better, I know how it works! It was not copy and paste. I actually understood every part of it. 

It's just a simple SDL window that shows sprites of Link from one of the old Legend of Zelda games. The sprites change directions depending on which key I press. Up, down, left and right. Now I  will try to figure out how to make the sprites change while I hold the key so I can make it look like Link is walking towards the direction I am holding. 

Again, it's very simple for most people here but I just wanted to share because I think it's the first time I felt like I had fun with it instead of just being frustrated. 

Hope you all have a happy new year!

Comment: That's a great early step which will make it easier to gradually take further steps into bigger software architectures. Keep going! :) That's how we all learned.
