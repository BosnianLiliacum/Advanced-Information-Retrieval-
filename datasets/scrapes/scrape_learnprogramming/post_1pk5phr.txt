I'm new to programming and currently deciding for what IDE to use. Just tried vs code and found out it's missing a lot of features Intellij has. As a beginner I like the diagrams in Intellij and also code navigation is much easier there (Data flow to/from here helps, find usages etc.).  
So my question is are this features like UML diagrams, sequence diagrams, dependency matrices and all the code navigation features just a gimmick that I find useful for my small/medium codebases and will break when the codebase gets larger or are professionals also use them?  
Thank you.

After 30 years, I don't care what the IDE is. I've used `notepad.exe` for a while, ed, vim, emacs, Visual Studio, Code Blocks, Eclipse, Jet Brains, Notepad++, Atom, Sublime, JOE, KEdit, KWrite, TextPad, xcode... It's all the same. Just get text into file however you can. There's no silver bullet. No religion. No editor war. The tool is a means to an end. It does not define you.
