We all hear the same “big four” recommendations over and over: C/C++, Java, Python. They’re solid, no doubt. But I’m curious about what comes after that.

If you were starting today, which non-mainstream language would you choose to learn, and why?  
I’m thinking about languages that might be in higher demand in the future or already quietly growing in importance.

Some examples people often mention:

* Go reminded me of simplicity + backend/cloud use
* Rust seems huge for systems programming and safety
* Zig, Nim, Julia, Kotlin, Elixir, etc.....

Questions I’m curious about:

* Which language do you think has the best long-term career value?
* Is it better to pick something industry driven (cloud, infra, embedded) or niche but powerful?
* Any regrets learning (or not learning) a certain language earlier?

Comment: A programming language is a tool. You don't ask yourself which tool to use and then choose which problems to solve. A problem comes your way, and you select the appropriate tool.
