So, I am a third year(second year discounting prep year where we only focus on English) cs student. I entered this major with the full belief that I will enjoy it and have fun in it. que forward two years in the major, i am behind in the practical aspect, can't code from scratch, and feeling imposter syndrome since i only know the theory and not how to apply it. a week ago i decided to go all out and code a basic one level rpg game. lo and behold it ended terribly lol.

today i thought "Y'know what? if i suck at that then maybe i can try the simplest project in the book."

so I coded a simple number guessing game from scratch, and it ran. 

i felt proud to say the least, felt the reason as to why  i entered this major, and if i can do this, then maybe, i can with what's after.

  
just wanted to share :)

Comment: Dude that's awesome! The number guessing game is like the "hello world" of actual projects - simple but you actually built something that works

  
The jump from theory to "holy shit I made a thing" is real, congrats on pushing through the imposter syndrome
