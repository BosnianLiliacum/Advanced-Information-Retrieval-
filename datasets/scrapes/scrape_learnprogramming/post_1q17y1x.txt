So recently, i learnt html and css and starting with javascript. But I have been struck in tutorial hell. So i want to start doing project-based learning. Any suggestions to get started and ideas? It can be related to web dev or any other thing to add

Comment: John Crickett has a selection of [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro) aimed at solving this exact problem.

They're tagged by difficulty, it's worth doing some of the beginner ones too.

Comment: I'm not sure what can help you exercise initiative , because you needed people to do your work for you. You cannot succeed if you expect to always be spoonfed.
