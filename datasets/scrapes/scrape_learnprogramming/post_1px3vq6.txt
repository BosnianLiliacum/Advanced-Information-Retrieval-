Hey everyone, im a cs student and currently exploring things. As a beginner what you tend to do is exactly what i have been doing. I learnt (just explored, not completely) python c cpp and just recently java. I really liked java out of these. C cpp feels very strict language  and python felt like it was very lazy, unserious, and very indisciplined language. 

 

I felt java somewhere in the middle of this. I dont know whether my views of these languages are actually true or not, but id like to hear from you whats your opinion. 

Also should i continue with java and dig deeper, and explore more?

Comment: Java as a language, especially recent Java, is totally fine. It's a totally fine teaching language.

Java *in the workplace* is miserable because Spring is a monstrosity of complexity and is basically its own language.

Comment: I also enjoy Java... then I learned C#, which is basically a more modern, better Java, and my eyes were opened to how much better life was as a C# dev.

Comment: If you like java then stick with it. Especially as a beginner it's much more important to learn computational thinking than a specific language

Comment: You can build a whole career in Java.

I built it in C/C++.

Many people disagree with me, but I consider Python just a helper language.

In your case you are fine. You found a language you like. And the market likes it as well.
