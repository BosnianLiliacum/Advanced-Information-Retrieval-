I followed the advice to code daily and honestly just burned myself out  
Leetcode tutorials repeat  
Now im questioning what daily practice even means  
For people who actually improved what does coding daily look like for you

Comment: You are looking for "kata".  Go search for coding katas and do one a day.

Go visit adventofcode and do one a day 


I'm going to get down votes, but Leetcode is for algorithm practice, not "coding" practice.  Think of it as you are building a wall each day.  Now you need to go build a room.  Once you are comfortable with that, build a floor, then a building, then a block, then a city ..etc etc

Comment: Don't code random stuff; code something useful for you, or your friend, or your kid, or your parent. Small, big, doesn't matter. Don't focus just on the coding, but on the entire project. Conceptuating, researching, planing, documenting. Coding by itself is useless if it leads to nothing meaningful.

Comment: Take some time to code away from the code. Sketch out the architecture of a project out on some paper. Write some pseudocode. If you're weak on maths, go sharpen up your linear algebra or matrices.


You'll find that, theoretically, that a project doesn't need to have amazing code with perfectly formed data structures and optimised algorithms. But learning to build good architecture will help a lot. 


Think breadth, not depth for a while. Keeping with the house analogy, you can try learning a lot of deep stuff to build a house made out of bricks, or you can try making a house out of sticks first and learn the overall architecture.
