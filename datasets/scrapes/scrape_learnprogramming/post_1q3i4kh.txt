I’ve been trying to learn tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform for months now and I feel stuck.

I have a short attention span, so I start strong, follow some tutorials, then lose focus and drop it… then repeat the cycle. I really want to get good at this stuff but I’m struggling to find a learning method that actually works for me.

For those of you who successfully learned these tools: 

what approach finally clicked?

How did you stay focused and avoid tutorial hell?

Would love to hear what worked for real people.

Thanks!

Comment: Docker is a trivial tool, you learn the basics of it in 15 minutes. 

It's best not to learn tools just to check a box, learn them to solve a problem you have. 

The best way to learn a Docker is making a project, then seeing how you can containerize it. Watch a 20 minute video, make the Dockerfile with the needed commands, build it, then run the container. You get started very quickly. If there's a genuine reason you need Docker, learning more advanced things won't be difficult, because you'll be eager to fix the problem you have. If you watch a Docker vid just to do Docker you'll be bored out of your mind

Comment: Buy a high rated udemy course and listen at 2x speed while I do other work.  I will go back and rewatch some parts at 1.5x speed once I’m done.

Picked a small personal project that isn’t the tutorial, then did that after.

Comment: Docked is dead simple really, I’d start with that. I’d you don’t understand how to work with containers locally by themselves within docked there’s not a chance you’ll know work with to do k8s. Learn incrementally.

Comment: Use it.

For something non-trivial.

You will learn it. Guaranteed.

YMMV on that for things that are not about a specific technology, but for the skills you listed, just use them.

You will remember enough to use it in practice later someday when you need it if you do it that way too.

Save what you did in git or similar and upload it somewhere or you willl be like "oh, that thing I did that one time, what was it? I suddenly need it now." and have no answer.
