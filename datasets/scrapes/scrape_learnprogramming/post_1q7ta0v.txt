I graduated with a CS degree from a decently good college, but could never code on my own. I want to know how to fully understand coding in the most efficient way possible. I know it will take a lot of time, but I want to make sure I am taking the most efficient and effective path possible to ACTUALLY learn how to code. I'm currently unemployed and looking for non-tech/tech-adjacent roles (because I won't pass the coding assessments) so that I can have a job and go from there. Any advice on the best path to take?

Comment: I’m curious, did your entire CS degree never have you code at all or do you mean you never learned design patterns and how to tie everything together?

My college taught me most concepts (formal language and automata theory, DSA, design patterns, machine architecture) through actual coding (OCaml, C, C++, Java, minimal Python only in my intro class). I get where you’re coming from, college is highly focused on theory and usually requires a specific “Software Engineering” elective class to fill in the production part of software.

Comment: This may sound trite, but, just .. sit down and do it ?

There's no substitute for just sitting down and banging away at it until you get it.
