A couple things to clarify in my asking of this question...

1. I'm about to get into programming again, and I know I'm gonna pick 1 of 2 languages, which I've already done the research on, so I know they both do what I wanna do, so this ain't a what-to-use question. This is an I'm-genuinely-curious-what-other-coders-use question. Just asking for fun &amp; community &amp; such. Your answers will not be informing my language choice, no offense 😅

2. I don't wanna know the language you use to make a living on the job, but the language that you specifically use when you're *not* on the clock.... unless those languages just happen to be the same 😅

Comment: C. It's the only language I enjoy programming in, if I am using something else it's certainly not by choice or for fun.

Comment: C# is great, and each dotnet release is killer.

Performance is great, tooling is great, ecosystem in general is great.

Comment: I've been having a lot of fun with Go for the past 10 years or so. I like the lack of "magic" and the really easy built-in concurrency.
