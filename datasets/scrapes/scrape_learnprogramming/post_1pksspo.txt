I am preparing for a Microsoft interview. I have been doing self preparation from 6 months but still i am getting stuck on easy level LeetCode problems. I have an issue with DSA foundation concept understanding. My plan is to join a top tech IT organization in 2026 as an SDE. Which DSA course is good for working professionals like me with 5 years of experience? After searching, I found LogicMojo, Coding Ninjas, Scaler, which are good among these to join. Scaler is a bit costly as they charge 3.5 Lakh. Any other options or suggestions?

Comment: Since you mentioned foundational DSA concepts, you should learn this properly from a textbook. Are you coding in Python? If so, there is a great textbook that teaches DSA with Python:  [https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275/)   
This is an academic textbook used in CS undergrad courses. Rigorous, and hands on. Do the in-chapter exercises - type them out, and make them work. Then, go on to the back of chapter exercises.   
Solutions to back of chapter questions are provided here:  
[https://github.com/wdlcameron/Solutions-to-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python](https://github.com/wdlcameron/Solutions-to-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-in-Python)

As always, give the problems your best efforts first, then look at the solutions. 

Recently, Perplexity has come up with a "learning" mode, you can use it to give you hints and guide you as you try out the back of chapter exercises.

All the best!

Comment: None of them are worth anything!

DSA isn't some mysterious unobtainable secret knowledge that can only be achieved through monetary means. It is literally a collection of very well known data structures and algorithms that everyone should know, or atleast partially understand.

I'd recommend a good textbook, doesn't matter how old it is, if it is older than 1968, just look elsewhere for red-black trees and A\*.

You don't even need to read the book, but you can, if you like the writing style - otherwise, just go by the table of contents, and look at wikipedia-articles (or other sources if you prefer) for understanding Binary Search, Big-O, Dynamic Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues, Trees and Graphs, Sorting (bubble, insertion, merge and quick), and look into pathfinding with Dijkstra and A\*. That'll take you through the basics. Then add-on whatever you find interesting with heaps, other kinds of trees, search-algorithms, etc. Links are at the bottom of every wikipedia-article on any data structure or algorithm.

Work with implementing everything yourself - plan code on paper, and code it by hand - DO NOT USE AI to write code! Expand the algorithms to count and display iterations, and keep track of both time and space - make sure you "experience" the complexity, don't just try to remember definitions.

If you need additional explanations for certain subjects, look for free videos or articles, look for university courses (MIT has exceptional free course materials available online), or ask an AI - they are good at explaining this stuff, and only rarely get it wrong!

You'll be better at truly understanding DSA than anyone following any of these paid courses!

Comment: Books &gt; yt/paid stuff.

Content creator's main goal is to get views/clicks. Sure if you learn something, that's great, but that's not their main goal.

DS/A are nice cause they almost never change, just need to understand the concepts and learn to implement maybe in 1-2 languages.

The biggest challenges ( at least for me ) was understanding word problems and translating them to the appropriate DS/A. 


&gt; i am getting stuck on easy level LeetCode problems

Sounds like you may also have the same problem (translating what's presented into the math). Maybe you can work on that first. 

You could also gather data on which types of problems you're having the most trouble with, either recognizing and/or implementing and look up ways to understand those better.

Comment: How about the NeedCode? Try it, it is really good. He has a roadmap mentioned by one guy , he basically used that for his own roadmap....

Also, for the long term you need some good thick book on DSA. smth like "Algorithms and Data Structures in C++" by M.Allen, D.Weiss...it is in C++, but great one. 

Good luck!

Comment: Princeton’s Algorithms courses on coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) are excellent (and free!). It will take a while to work through them, but it’s well worth the time and effort. I think MIT has an algorithms course on OCW that is supposed to be good too, but I don’t have direct experience with that. 

Some discrete math would be beneficial too. Prof. Kimberly Brehm has two discrete math courses on YouTube (https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz). They follow along with Rosen’s “Discrete Math and Its Applications.” I’ve used both the YouTube videos and textbook as a resource when tutoring students. MIT’s Math for Computer Science on OCW is supposed to be a good one too.
