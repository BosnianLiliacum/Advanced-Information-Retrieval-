First of all have a nice day everyone 
So I am currently in my 4thsem(cse) and I have just starred programming seriously, before this I was just exploring yt videos, tried cyber too(learning linux kali in VMware and some tools) currently I am learning java from mooc helensky and I don't want to make previous mistakes I want to make projects please suggest some projects from beginner to advanced and the stuff I need to have to build these projects. I want to be a good programmer/engineer, I am ready to put in the work as for now all of the projects I have made are with the help of ai, but I have decided I will not use ai, as of now  I have made a cli todolist (without help of ai)

Comment: Beginner projects are probably the really common ones. A TODO app. A Calculator. Call a simple API like the Pokemon API and display the Pokemon stats. 


For web development, beginner projects like these are suggested all the time

Comment: Hey there and you have a nice day too! Doing it yourself is exactly how you build the logic muscles that AI usually skips. MOOC Helsinki is gold so definitely stick with that.

Here is a solid progression path with the specific skills you need for each stage.

**Beginner Skills**

* **Core Logic** You need to master `if` `else` statements and loops like `for` and `while` to control the flow.
* **Data Handling** Get comfortable with `int` `double` and `String` types and using the `Scanner` class to get input from the user.
* **OOP Basics** For things like a Bank Simulator you specifically need to understand Classes Objects and Constructors. You also need to learn Encapsulation which just means using `private` variables and `public` getter and setter methods to protect your data.

**Beginner Project Ideas**

* **Number Guessing Game** This is a classic for a reason. It forces you to use random number generation loops and conditional logic to tell the user if they guessed too high or too low.
* **Console Calculator** Build a calculator that runs in the terminal. It helps you practice breaking your code into separate methods for addition subtraction multiplication and division.
* **Simple Quiz** Create a multiple choice quiz. You will need to use arrays to store the questions and answers and a loop to cycle through them while keeping score.

**What you need** You really just need a good IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse and you should absolutely start using Git for version control right now. 

Good luck and keep putting in the work!
