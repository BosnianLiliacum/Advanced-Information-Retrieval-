Post Content:
I'm not a new developer, but I recently started to suffer from the "I'm overwhelmed" feeling. I find motivation to work on project X, start working on it then progressively demotivate myself with thoughts like "Why bother making this when someone already made this, but better?".

I am aware I should be making projects **for me**, and not for someone else. But it is hard to justify spending hours/days/weeks working on something, wanting to share it then being told "oh, Y already does it but better."

I'd consider myself a library programmer, so it is quite demotivating to be unable to make something by myself for others to enjoy...

Comment: Sometimes I want to cook a cool recipe I found online but then I realize, the person who made the recipe has already cooked it so honestly why bother.

Comment: Building something is only a fraction of the project, then you gotta market it, manage it, maintain it, sell it 

If you are just developing your building skills, then it hardly matters if it exists already

If you are trying to start a business then perhaps you are  hiding in your comfort zone.

Comment: That's how I feel about learning guitar. Why should I spend hours/days/weeks learning to play something when there is already someone out there doing it better?

Edit: Yes, people. That was my point.
