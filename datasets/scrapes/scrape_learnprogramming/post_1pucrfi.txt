I've only started learning programming. I've finished a foundations course which introduced HTML, CSS. And JavaScript. I am very interested In making games and looked into Unity, which uses C#. So I'm just wondering, if I decide to take time to learn C# am I in a way just 'wasting' time or is C# a good language which has skills that are transferrable to other languages? 

I don't have a college degree in CS so I know that getting a job as a programmer is already an uphill battle so a part of me doesn't want to waste too much time learning something that won't be really beneficial.

Comment: Programming isn't about any particular language. Programming is about thinking like a programmer, which is a systematic approach to problem solving and troubleshooting. These skills can be learned in any language and transferred to any other language.

That said, C# is an incredibly powerful, popular language used in just about every industry in tens of thousands of companies. Unity's usage of C# is somewhat different than standard line-of-business software, but go and re-read my first paragraph.

Comment: In 2025, C# was the 5th most used programming language according to GitHub. The number 1 and 3 languages, TypeScript and JavaScript, can be used and are used often in conjunction with C#.

Comment: C# is one of the most common languages for modern large scale projects. If you know C#, you'll be able to pick up Java easily too.

Comment: Yeah, I prefer C# over Java for RESTful API backend. It felt way easier than Java.
