Looking for free, legit certificates that add real value on LinkedIn.

Preferably from:
- recognized platforms
- skill-based learning (tech, data, backend, ML basics)
- available without payment

Not looking for random PDFs. Only certificates that recruiters respect.

Comment: None in my opinion,

Most recruiters have *zero* clue about tech, and most hiring managers care about *experience*.

The value you get out of a certificate is the amount of time you spent studying — the paper (or digital) certificate is pretty meaningless.

A few like CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) are solid, but the cost alone is $445, and you could also just self study.

Comment: I'd say Harvard cs50x is a nice free one. And no certificates are of high value in programming. You need a strong portfolio.

Comment: Maybe some general certifications from google, but if you're talking technical they're all paid like from the big cloud providers (Azure, AWS,GCP)

Comment: Certifications are sometimes required to even get an interview.  
Sometimes they're preferred (to get a leg up on the competition).

I've never heard of anyone asking for a certificate.

You know the truth in today's market?  ATSs are doing all the scouring of resumes and a well written resume is more important than a solid candidate; it's more important than experience and certifications.  Your resume has to align perfectly with the job requirements, which means, copy, paste, and **lie**.  I don't care if you don't know APIs.  If they require it, you know it, so put it down.   Go take a crash course so when you get an interview, you can bullshit 'em.  That's the world today.  Get the interview, then pull out your cock.

LinkedIn is used to dig up dirt, to eliminate candidates.  I'll be brief and you can ask if you want me to elaborate, but have a clean profile, recent job history, not too many jobs, remove gaps...

Comment: The only certificates that matter are proper University degrees and certificates from companies like Microsoft, Oracle, Google, Cisco, Amazon - and all these are paid (and quite expensive).

The free certificates are not even worth the storage they consume. They are just *attendance/completion certificates* that don't tell anything about actual *competence*.
