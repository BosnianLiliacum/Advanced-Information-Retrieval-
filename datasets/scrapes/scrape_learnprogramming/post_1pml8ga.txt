I struggle a lot with learning programming because I need a clear, ordered path (books/courses in a fixed sequence), similar to how medicine has anatomy → physiology → clinical practice.

Most advice I get is “just build projects” or “learn as you go”, but that doesn’t work for me.

How did *you* actually learn?  
Did you follow a structured curriculum, or did you piece things together over time?

I’m trying to understand if this lack of structure is inherent to programming, or if I’m missing something.

Comment: Have you heard of [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) or of [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)?

Also, every single University curriculum. Plenty courses available from Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, University of Helsinki, and many more.

Also, programming has way more different paths than medicine.

Comment: Medicine is very regulated. It’s structured because, if it wasn’t, doctors couldn’t actually be doctors. You wouldn’t want someone to become a surgeon because they did a “surgery project” (which sounds horrifying). The same is not true for programming, projects are often times great showcases of learning. 

If building projects and learning as you go doesn’t work for you, I would suggest looking for a field that has a more structured and regulated education.

You're missing something. Programming has many well defined structured paths, when not a formal curriculum they are often called Roadmaps, there are one even for Unity.

Comment: There is, it's called Computer Science and it's taught at accredited universities, just like medicine and the various specializations.

What is it that you're missing?

Comment: I would say this is exactly what you get if you get a BS in Computer Science at a good university.
