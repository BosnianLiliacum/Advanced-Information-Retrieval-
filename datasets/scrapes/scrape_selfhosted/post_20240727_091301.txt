Post Content:
I know there are lists such as [awesome self-hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) of software you can self-host and which is open source.

However, many of those tools are in practice **open core** and place limits on the open-source/free variants.

Edit to clarify:  I'm looking for a list that only contains tools of which full functionality is available in the free open source self-hosted version. So no features are locked behind a paywall

Are there any lists of open source, self-hostable tools which do not impose *any* limits on self-hosting for free?

Edit 2: This post is being downvoted. I don't understand what it so "wrong" about my post? Please explain to me the hidden rules and ethics of this community so I can understand what I can and cannot do within this community.

  Comment: Did you try [https://selfh.st/apps/?](https://selfh.st/apps/)  
You can filter out open and/or closed source apps, and they have a nice weekly newsletter with interesting news...

  Comment: Why do you care?  If a tool provides everything you want in terms of free features, why does it matter if it also has paid features that you don't want/need?
