Post Content:
for over a year now, i have been self hosting things on my raspberry pi 3b+ that i got online for very very cheap. 

now i have been thinking of upgrading my home server to that is not arm based so that i could run x32 x64 things on it that could not be ran on an arm processor.

i have been thinking of getting an preowned old mini pc such as an i5 5th gen or i3 5th gen, however i am very concerened about the power usage. electricity is expensive in our country so i want something power efficient like a raspberry pi. 

any suggestions?

  Comment: An N100 setup should serve you well. My monitoring of the cpu alone gauges 6w on average use and maybe 15w when it rarely gets 100% cpu. 


This has been my core setup the past year.

  Comment: I run a bunch of HP G3 Minis, they generally run at 10-12w with SSDs at idle (higher with use of course). It also depends what you're using them for; you could set them to turn off at night for example and spin up each morning.

  Comment: I'm using HP ProDesk G4 Mini with i5 8th working pretty well and idles at 7 to 8W. Good for your needs. I/o also looks fine for me.

  Comment: Why do you exclude SBCs ? They are frequently among the most power-efficient hardware.

  Comment: I would suggest you a HP Elitedesk or Prodesk. Throw in a 2TB ssd, max the ram to 32gb, upgrade to the i7 T series processor (low power), and you have a really decent server for less than 150€ when buying used of course.

They really work excellent and use about 40w power. That's about the same as a modern super fast phone charger.

  Comment: Odroid H4+ (N97 is better than N100) and also it supports in-band ECC for RAM. Idle: &lt;4W

  Comment: I use a TRIGKEY Ryzen 7 Mini PC which has 8 Cores, 16 Threads with an AMD PC 5800H（Up to 4.4GHz), 32G DDR4 Ram and a 500G NVME SSD. Its a beast of a mini PC and only uses around 35 watts. 

Its been amazing at everything i've thrown at it and works well as a dedicated games server too using Amp Game server software. 

All my services are dockerised and im hosting around 40 containers in 21 or so services and memory is less than half and cpu barely reads. Its a powerful little bugger lol
