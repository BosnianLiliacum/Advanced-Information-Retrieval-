I'm running NGINX proxy manager in a docker with a wildcard cert from letsencrypt.  Is there some way to copy the certs to other servers that don't go through NGINX?

  Comment: It's fairly trival. Like someone mentioned, you need a DNS-provider with an API, and then for me, the easiest way was to use [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh)

After [setting that up to use your DNS-providers API](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi), it'll download the wildcard-cert, that I then can copy to whatever machine I want. I'm using a wildcard-cert for my Synology NAS:es for example. I have a simple cronjob that automatically updates them.

  Comment: Yes. They should be available in the mounted volume for the certs unless you didn’t have that mounted then you should. I do this all the time with certs my traefik instance creates and copy them for example to mailcow so smtp and imap are ssl encrypted with valid certs.

  Comment: I didn’t know you could get wildcard certificates from Let’s Encrypt. 
What do you exactly mean? Like using scp to copy the certificate and private key to other servers? Sure you can

  Comment: Here you go, you can generate wildcard certificates on any server you want without opening any ports etc.

  Comment: Can let’s encrypt get a certificate for a .local domain? My server is not exposed to the public just using it for local rdweb
