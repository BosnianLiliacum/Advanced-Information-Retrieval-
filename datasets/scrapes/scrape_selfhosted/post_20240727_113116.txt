Hey Reddit!

[Belullama](https://preview.redd.it/o82v6farsoed1.png?width=192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f370b277a3e389dc834e1a46df2423a92408f3d)

I'm excited to announce the release of Belullama, a comprehensive AI application that bundles the latest versions of Ollama, Open WebUI, and Automatic1111 (Stable Diffusion WebUI) into a single, easy-to-use package.



🔗 GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/ai-joe-git/Belullama](https://github.com/ai-joe-git/Belullama)



🚀 Key Features:

- All-in-One AI Platform: Integrates Ollama, Open WebUI, and Automatic1111

- Easy Setup: Simple installer script for quick deployment

- Conversational AI: Create and manage chatbots with ease

- Image Generation: Use Stable Diffusion models through Automatic1111 WebUI

- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive interaction with language models

- Offline Operation: Run entirely on your local machine for privacy and security

- Extensibility: Customize to meet your specific needs



💻 Installation:

Stand-alone installation is as simple as running:

\`\`\`

curl -s [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-joe-git/Belullama/main/belullama\_installer.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-joe-git/Belullama/main/belullama_installer.sh) | sudo bash

\`\`\`

We also offer an optional installation for CasaOS users.



🤔 Why Belullama?

Belullama aims to simplify the process of setting up and using powerful AI tools locally. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, Belullama provides a streamlined way to experiment with large language models and image generation.



We welcome contributions, feedback, and feature requests. Check out our GitHub repository for more details and to get started!

  Comment: I know you mentioned at one time doing one that uses Nvidia GPUs.. Is this the one or are you still working on another release? If so I give you so much credit for putting so much effort and time into these. Thank you.
