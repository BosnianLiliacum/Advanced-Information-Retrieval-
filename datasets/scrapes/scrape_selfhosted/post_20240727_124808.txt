I want to setup a webserver with https support via caddy unfortunately i don't have static public ip. So i use No-IP for dynamic dns. Is there any way to point my normal \`www.example.com\` to my no-ip dns \`example.ddns.net\` but with working https. I tried this before but caddy threw a error that my domain needs A type record and it can't solve ACME challenge

  Comment: If you own a domain you can skip the dyndns completely.

Just update your domain ip to your current ip with your favourite tool.

Dyndns is only needed if one doesn't want to buy a own domain.
