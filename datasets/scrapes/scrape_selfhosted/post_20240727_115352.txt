Hey all—

I was looking for a free, self-hosted alternative to TextExpander/TextBlaze etc. Ideal features:

* Multi-platform: iOS, Windows, Mac
* Chromium extension
* Support Rich Text
* Support advanced fields (date, time, forms, etc)

My Google searches haven't turned up anything and couldn't find anything similar on [Awesome-Self-Hosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted). 

Appreciate y'all's help!

  Comment: What is a server needed for ? Syncing your saved expressions between clients ? Couldn't you do this keepass style and use something FOSS and purely clientside to do the expanding, and sync the file of expansions out to each client with syncthing ?

  Comment: I don't think this is possible on iOS, for basic needs you can use the included text replacement.

For macOS (and Windows IIRC) I know espanso -- already mentioned in another comment.

I've never looked into browser extensions, why would you need that if it's available system wide?

AND: there is nothing to host for this type of application, if you want to have the replacements available everywhere, just sync them like every other config.
