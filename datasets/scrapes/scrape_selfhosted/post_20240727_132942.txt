Post Content:
I found it some time ago while searching for a platform for my personal site. It has everything I need, a blog, a private section, all the customisations, but it's not developed anymore.

After trying to find a better alternative I took the plunge and installed it last night. Started migrating my content, setting up templates etc and it looks great. The minor issue I am having right now is the search results not showing thumbnails of cover images, but that's minor.


Obviously, the big issue is the security risk. I want to use it, but I'm worried that if a potential bug is found, I'm risking losing access, etc.

I can't use Wordpress, Wix, Drupal or Joomla. I need something as quick, as '2000s-style' looking, customisable as b2evolution.

Are there any worthy self-hosted alternatives?

  Comment: I'm in the same boat; I am still running it, but my plan is to migrate to a static site generator (like Jekyll, Nikola or Hugo) in the future. They are not quite the same thing, but for my use case they still constitute a good fit.

  
The reason to migrate is that with a static site generator I can lower the requirements for the server - no need for a database or a PHP interpreter, hence it can run on a low-spec machine.

Given my current workload in life, I think that realistically I'll be "temporarily" using b2evo for a long time. If it isn't broken, don't fix it.
