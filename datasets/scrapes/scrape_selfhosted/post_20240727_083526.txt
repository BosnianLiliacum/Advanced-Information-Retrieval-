Post Content:
My server has 1Gbit and 10Gbit network and my local has 1Gbit network. When using Iperf with argument -P 10, it max out my speed at local (about 800Mbit/s). However, when sync file using FTP/SFTP, even I use CuteFTP and set threads/stream to 8-10, the speed is capped about 4-50Mb/s (4-5MB/s). Is there other option that I can try?

  Comment: rsync/rclone for large or multiple transfers. 

[croc](https://github.com/schollz/croc) for small or singular transfers.
