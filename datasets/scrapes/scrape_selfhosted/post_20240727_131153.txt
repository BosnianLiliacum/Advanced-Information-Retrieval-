Wondering what else i can use my cluster for? I don't do streaming / torrents as this is taken care of via a friend. So looking for more nerdy projects / apps to run, but can't seem to think of anything.

Maybe home assistant but I heard that's a bit to run in kubernetes. 

The unifi button is out of action, I'm moving soon and going to set up a unifi network then .

  Comment: You can’t run supervised Home Assistant in k8s, however it isn’t that hard to get working as a standalone installation. You’ll have to have Multus installed if you want to do service discovery and such.
