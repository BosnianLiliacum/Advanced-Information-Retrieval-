Post Content:
I have around 1000 PDFs from the 1960s that I need to extract data from for analysis. These PDFs contain numerical and date-time data, and I require high accuracy and well-formatted results. I’ve tried using Table-Transformer and Pytesseract, but they didn’t work well for me.

Can anyone suggest effective methods or tools for extracting and formatting data from these PDFs accurately?

Here is a screenshot of a page from one of the PDFs:

Thanks for Your help

  Comment: No idea, never tried anything like this so I'm very curious to see what you find that works for you.

That said you might have better luck doing this in two pieces -- first piece is OCR, second piece is converting to proper tables.

  Comment: From my experience, using Claude Opus can make awesome results, but you have to be more specific with the prompts.  
Claude has a great OCR
