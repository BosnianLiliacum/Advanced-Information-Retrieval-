Post Content:
I am looking for a self hosted solution to rate my large photo library by AI. I currently use synology photos on my NAS, have checked out imich as an option (if it comes out of beta) and a few others.

What I am looking for is a way to automate the star rating in photos by having a process running which evaluates photo quality using ai (lighting, focus, people with closed eyes, etc). I would use it's results to update the photos star rating and use that in my photo DAM tool of choice (currently synology photos). I know of cloud tools that rate photos, but I would prefer to host this myself.

Ideas on what to use?

  Comment: Excire Foto does that. It is not for free but impressive accurate

  Comment: Have you looked into PhotoPrism? It's an AI-driven photo management tool you can self-host, and it might be able to automate star ratings based on quality. I use it alongside Guidde to create quick tutorial videos for my team, which saves me tons of time.
