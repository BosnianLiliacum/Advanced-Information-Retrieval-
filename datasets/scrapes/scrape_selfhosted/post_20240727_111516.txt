Hello!

Finally getting around to configuring data collection for my lab network and after fusing around with Ntopng (worked great but I don't have an Nprobe license) and Akvorado (could never get it to work properly with data coming from my MikroTik gear), I've settled on Graylog for collecting IPFIX data.

I've configured the data ingress so now I'm just looking for any resources on how to create a dashboard for this type of data. I've already found guides for IP geo location in Graylog's docs but I was wondering if there was an add on that emulated [the flow charts of other Netflow analyzers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Ntopng.png).

Any pointers or resources on this would be much appreciated.

  Comment: Check out [akvorado](https://github.com/akvorado/akvorado). It uses Clickhouse as the datastore, which is probably going to work much better than the Elastic that Graylog uses.
