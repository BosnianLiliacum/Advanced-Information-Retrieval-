I'm struggling with a DDNS issue, and I'm hoping y'all can help me out. I've done this a million times before, but it was years ago and today, for some reason, I'm at a loss.

1. I own MyExample.com over at Mochahost. 
2. I took out a FreeMyIP.com account. I used to use DuckDNS but I wanted to swtich it up a little. So I have Birthday.FreeMyIP.com. 
3. I created a CNAME record for a subdomain in the Zones section of Mochahost that points WebApp.MyExample.com to Birthday.FreeMyIP.com. 
4. I have a WebApp on my home server running on http://1.2.3.4:8080 and https://1.2.3.4:8443
5. In DD-WRT, I set up the DDNS tab using the FreeMyIP.com config settings with my token. It's updating fine. 
6. I have an instance of Nginx Proxy Manager running on Docker and it's active at 1.2.3.4 at ports 80, 443, and 81. 
7. In DD-WRT, I'm am forwarding :80 to 1.2.3.4:80 which is my NPM, right? 
8. In NPM, I have an entry with WebApp.MyExample.com pointing to 1.2.3.4:8080

When I go to WebApp.MyEaxmple.com it brings up the login screen for my DD-WRT which strikes me as bonkers. 

When I go to Birthday.FreeMyIP.com:8443 (just out of curiosity) it gives me nothing. That \*used\* to take me to WebApp, but not any more. 

What have I done? Something is right, if WebApp.MyEaxmple.com it brings up the login screen for my DD-WRT. But something is also horribly wrong.

  Comment: The first thing you need to do is figure out how to disable remote web interface on your router. That shouldn't be enabled and is a huge security risk.
