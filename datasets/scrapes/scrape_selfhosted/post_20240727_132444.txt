I am looking for a way to create a gps track when I am out sailing.

The tracking will need to be local as I will often be without cell service.

I thoght owntracks might work but either I don’t have it setup properly or it doesn’t store the gps track locally then uploading it once a connection is restored.

  Comment: I use a SPOT Tracker for tracking my location on long (multi-day) motorcycle rides.  The SPOT sends your location directly to a satellite every 5-10 minutes, and doesn't rely on cell towers or any terrestrial connections.

You can view your track on the SPOT website, but I use a third-party site called Spotwalla for this.  Spotwalla has a much better user interface, and allows you to configure "trips" using a start time and and end time.

  Comment: Although traccar is something you could use, it's designed to be used with a cell service.

Like you said you'd need to find a service that works locally.

You could diy one or see if there is a phone app that will save locally
