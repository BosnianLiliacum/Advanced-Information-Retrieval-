I know they are old but all I'd be using it for is network storage, I've got a different server to run apps and what not. I'd just want to host a zfs pool on it.

  Comment: [Marvell CPU w/256 MB DDRII](https://www.qnap.com/en/product/ts-412/specs/hardware). I doubt its OS supports ZFS at all, and with non-Intel CPU's you're stuck with QTS, but even if, with those specs...

Otherwise QNAP makes decent hardware. You should be fine with JBOD or RAID I, perhaps with not a lot of concurrent writes, like media file storage for the apps on the other server.

  Comment: There is no zfs for that one. It’s over a decade old I retired ( gave them to my brother) years ago because they are not up to standard anymore.
