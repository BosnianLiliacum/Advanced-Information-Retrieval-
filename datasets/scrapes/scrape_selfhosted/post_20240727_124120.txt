I purchased an used Dell Optiplex 3060 today for 14,000 INR (167 USD). I plan to set up services like Emby, Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Code Server, Navidrome, FreshRSS, Transmission, and some static public websites on it. Since I mostly live at university, which is far from my home for about 9 months a year, and have experience using a VPS, I would appreciate some recommendations on setting up my homelab and implementing backups. My home internet speeds are 300Mbps for both upload and download with a latency of 3ms, and my mobile bandwidth is virtually unlimited.

Dell Optiplex 3060 specifications:

- Intel i5-8500 (6) @ 3.000GHz

- 8GB DDR4

- 256GB M.2 SSD

- 2TB HDD

  Comment: I imagine you plan to leave your server in the house and not taking it with you to university, in this case I think setting VPN could be good idea, so that you'll be "in home" but physically far. It will remove the need to leave SSH available on the Internet.

Idk but maybe 8GB of ram could be too small if you plan to add more service by the time, like a collaboration platform like nextcloud + password manager + websites + tools like budibase that are nice for schools when mastered etc...

About home backups I will let other speak since I only have experiences about professionals backups, that are nothing in common with home backups.

Or course you need to setup firewall on Internet box / server in order to deny access to all port except the ones necessary

Hope it will help a lil bit!

Otherways are tailscale, VPN and Cloudfare tunnel.

  Comment: Just follow 3 2 1 rule, besides that there's a million ways doing backups. I personally love proxmox and its built in backup functionality for VMs and containers because it works universally for all applications and still does delta backups.

  Comment: I would recommend getting at least another 8gb of RAM if you're going to be running all of that at once, but otherwise, looks good! Make sure to use a wired connection, and set up a VPN to secure access to your virtual machines, I use Tailscale myself, but some others also recommend plain old Wireguard.
