  Comment: Is there any APIs for Garmin products? The data it produces is pretty good, but I'm not a fan of their website UI.

  Comment: Fascinating project! Does this query the data directly from your watch, or are you reliant on their Cloud API at all?

  Comment: Shit bro, I instantly saved this post to self host this project on my own and suddenly I figured out that it’s related to person health nor infrastructure XD

Great job anyway, seems pretty nice and usable in a lots of cases.
Anyway appreciate your sharing and for sure will leave a star on GitHub!

All good for you and family
