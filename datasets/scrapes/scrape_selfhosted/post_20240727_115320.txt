Anyone have some secret sauce to running OCIS in Unraid? I am struggling to get it to run under docker compose or docker, I am really close to creating a VM just for it but thats not going to work for me long term. Thanks everyone.

  Comment: It is amazing and sad that this app does not have a standard Docker file ready for installation.  People are touting it as a Nextcloud replacement, but can't really run it in a self-hosted environment.
