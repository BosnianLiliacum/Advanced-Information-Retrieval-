Post Content:
I was using Metube to download videos and manually delete them once I was done, but I wanted to automate this process. So, I created ChannelTube, which I’ve been using for almost a year now and seems to work OK.

This is a fairly niche service and I know there are more feature-rich options out there like tubearchivist, tubesync, ytdl-sub etc...

  
What ChannelTube does is simple: it downloads the latest videos from your selected channels, keeps them for a set period, and then automatically deletes them.

It doesn’t archive videos or offer manual selection or one-off downloads—it’s designed to manage a rolling window of content that you want to watch once rather than capturing full channels.

  Comment: I'm following a fuckton of channels on YouTube and I'm having the issue that you basically can't group them somehow.

"Retrogaming", "Philosophy", "IT" and so on. I found very silly that isn't possible to truly categorize channels, so I can quickly check new content on these topics and maybe review all content creator of different topics at once.

This could solve my issue somehow, even WITHOUT downloading them (just for truly organizing them in an meaningful matter).

Will keep an eye on it, thanks for your work :)

  Comment: Is it also possible to filter the video's it will download based on title? E.g. I want to only download new episodes of a certain series of a channel.

  Comment: Installed to try it out, it looks like there is some plex / jellyfin integration. Do I need to do anything other than put in Plex: &lt;server_token&gt; or is this a feature in progress?
