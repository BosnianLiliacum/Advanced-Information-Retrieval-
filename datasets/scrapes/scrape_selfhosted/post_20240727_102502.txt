I've tried Plex and Jellyfin. I've looked at the others that appear on google searches. These seem to be all optimized for serving peoples' collections of commercial films/movies and television shows. They gather metadata of all kinds, section into genres, grab poster art... This is not what I need.

I have a collection of random videos that I'd like to keep organized with tags, choose thumbnail frames, and play back across devices. Little more, no less.

Is there a media server made to do this well?

  Comment: Sure, stashapp.

Given, you didn't specify exactly what type of media you had.... going to assume, stashapp is the tool for you.

That being said, you don't have to enable metadata, and tagging on jellyfin..... You can have a library full of just your stuff too.

  Comment: I have the same issue and went with Fireshare. It’s a pretty remarkable piece of software for what it is.

  Comment: Sounds more like you didn’t use those tool in the right way. They all do what you want when used correctly.

  Comment: Sounds like Plex Server can already do everything you need it to do. I have a bunch of random videos on my Plex server, and as long as you set your specific library as "Other Videos," it won't auto-sort it into the Movies or TV shows category. I view this library by folder, and I can add tags, select thumbnail frames or upload my own photo, and it plays videos across all of my devices.

  Comment: PhotoPrism supports video and has tagging, even though it's designed for images.

  Comment: I’m jumping into this discussion because I had a similar need, and I didn’t want to overload my instances of PLEX and Jellyfin. After some searching, I found a solution: YouTube-style MediaCMS. I hope this can be useful to you.
