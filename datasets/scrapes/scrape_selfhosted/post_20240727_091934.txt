Hello,

  
I asked this questions over at r/Ubiquiti and never got any response. Hoping someone here might be able to help out? As with all my research i have still come up at a brick wall here.

I have setup a Unifi Cloud Gateway Ultra with a Self-hosted Radius server and OpenVPN. The Open VPN is using the Radius Server users for connection and have a few questions which I have at this stage failed to find any answers to.

All these questions are in context of using the Unifi Radius Server and VPN Host.

Can you set up Wiregaurd to use the Radius server like OpenVPN?

Is there a way to set up 2 Factor Authentication with the Radius server and or OpenVPN?

At the moment it seems that when a user accesses the OpenVPN route it doesn't use the Radius Servers assignment rules to assign them to a V-lan.  
Some of my Radius user get assigned to a V-Lan which have restricted access to other devices on the Network but have full access when using the VPN. Is there a way to exclude these user logins rights to use the VPN through the unifi system? Or otherwise write specific traffic rules/firewall rules to target these usernames in particular and restrict there access?

If the Above isn't possible/practical within just the Unifi System what is my best alternative route? I have a Synology NAS on the network which I could host FreeRadius? would this give me better options?  
Otherwise is there a Low-cost Cloud based Authenticator I could utilise with the Unifi setup?

Cheers for any help/guidance you guys can provide.

  Comment: Why are you using OpenVPN when Wireguard exists? I use Wireguard with 2FA.
