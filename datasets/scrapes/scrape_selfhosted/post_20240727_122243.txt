&lt;SOLVED!&gt; 

After I reseated all components in the machine and cleaned everything up, swapped wires and such, the problem continued, but this time it was calling out "sdf" instead.   I had moved the drives in the array around.  I removed all the drives from the array and BOOM!  Worked faster than you can imagine.  After I got Proxmox installed, I installed TrueNAS and pushed in all the drives.   Got that back online and now I'm dealing with one troubled 12TB drive. 

Now to get the last 3 nights of sleep back somehow....

Thank you everyone!!



Hello all,

I've got a Dell T630 with dual  Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v4, 128GB Ram and firmware should all be up to date.  I've been trying to get my server back online after a long time, so I wanted to do a clean install.

So, I downloaded the newest Proxmox 8-2 and it was great for the first few days.  I had a problem with TrueNas (Set as the only VM) and decided to reboot everything.  When I did, it was taking forever to boot and when i looked at the screen, it was having major SSD issues.  So today I swapped the SSD for a 4TB WD Red HD and tried to do a clean boot.

Now while trying to do a clean install again from a thumb drive, I'm seeing a ton of errors with: "Buffer i/o error, dev sda, sector,..."

I have reformatted the thumb drive and same error.  I have used another 8 GB thumb drive and still the same errors.   I am open to try anything at this point here.  Thank you!

  Comment: When you say the thumb drive, you mean the installation media, right? You're not running an OS from a USB stick are you?

  Comment: The server can have a bad sd card. Try wiping it or just removing it.  Typical use for those cards is to store installation media on them.
