  Comment: Try:

- https://github.com/LibreBooking/app
- First set up the cars and grounds as resources.
- In the calendar you can then search for free slots for a resource using "Find A Time" under "Reservations". Then bookings can be done against the resource.
- The software is an opensource version of BookedScheduler. You can see a [demo here](https://demo.bookedscheduler.com).
