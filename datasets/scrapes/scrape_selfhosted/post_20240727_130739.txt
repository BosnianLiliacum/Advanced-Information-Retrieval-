Hello !

**If you missed our previous update, we added new file support, auto-detect document orientation and** [more](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d9foj0/papermark_v0130_new_file_support_autodetect/)**.**

The latest update highlights:

Setting up a datarooms with dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of documents is hard work. It shouldn't be. We are excited to make the experience of **uploading many files at once easy and practically seamless**.

Papermark implements the [TUS protocol](https://tus.io/) to enable multiple and resumable uploads. TUS stands for The Upload Server and is an open protocol for **supporting resumable uploads**. The protocol allows the upload process to be resumed from where it left off, even **if the network crashes** and there are other interruptions.

Just drag your files into your dataroom or documents folder to start the upload. Files will uploaded to the selected folder.

* links in PDFs are clickable *in-place*

  Comment: Just as an advisory to users, the open code for this project [does require code](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Amfts%2Fpapermark+AND+%28%22%40%2Fee%2F%22+AND+NOT+path%3A%22ee%2F%22%29&amp;type=code) from non-open parts of the project which are under a non-open-source [commercial license](https://github.com/mfts/papermark/blob/main/ee/LICENSE). I believe you'd need to remove/re-implement these references to run this using fully open source code alone (and not be subject to the commercial terms) without error. Some prior discussion and context in [last month's post in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1d9foj0/comment/l7cyjcn/).

  Comment: Great update! The TUS protocol integration is a game-changer for bulk uploads. I recently started using beehiiv for my newsletter and found their advanced analytics super useful for tracking reader engagement, similar to how Papermark helps with document analytics. Keep up the awesome work!
