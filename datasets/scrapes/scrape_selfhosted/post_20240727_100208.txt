Has anyone else had issues connecting to their services in the last 24 hours? Could it be connected to the Microsoft outages across the USA? I cannot access my services locally with duckdns nor outside with cloudflare anymore.

  Comment: I also noticed the same thing. I came across this site that mentioned scheduled maintenance. I strongly suspect that it has to do with the outage
