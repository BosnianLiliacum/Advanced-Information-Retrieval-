Sorry if this isn't the correct sub for this question.

I currently have a few services running on docker, on a contabo server and a few of them are exposed to the internet.

I dud that by installing nginx and configuring everything myself from SSL, configuring reverse proxies, Https, redirects, etc..

And each time I push an update, I have to go on the server, pull the changes from GitHub manually then restart the containers.

Is there any easy to use service to manage all of this? Especially nginx and its configurations.

I heard about Portainer but have no idea if it has any benefit for me. I was looking for something preferably with a GUI.

Thanks.

  Comment: I use docker compose files for each of my services with traefik tags that handle  revers proxy auto ssl renewals. Watchtower handles all the container updates.  

Its worth learning so you save time manually updating . 30+ services with no needed maintenance

  Comment: Your problem has a lot of solutions, you could go with a full CI/CD deployment, Ansible playbook, or even just a script that runs everything you need. It depends on the work you want to put into it and the level of professional legitimacy you want to give it.

  Comment: I have all of my containers in docker compose, and manage their updates (as well as the updates for all of my physical systems and VMs) using ansible/rundeck

Ansible was/is a bit of a learning curve, but there are a lot of examples out there

  Comment: I’m using docker compose files with an Azure pipeline which has various steps such as creating and updating .env files with secret variables, so pulling images so anything on a latest tag gets updated, to then actually deploying my compose files
