&gt;Whats your ideal  DNS / webserver / Routing situation?

i was a frontend developer (react+webgl for robotics visualization) for 15 years but i want to learn backend for next few months (too many steve jobs wanna-be ceos who think they are gods gift to design)

right now im using

PORK BUN - dns  
CLOUD FLARE - just dns

Reverse Proxy - Caddy

WebServer - echo + go + htmx + etc

Will probably add sqlite and turso and some other stuff.

im not really attached to cloudflare or porkbun. not sure if theres better options. i had kinda had a lot of trouble adding new endpoints and stuff.

Should i move to traefik or FRP?

FRP seemed to have some cool features, and maybe i could remove cloudflare.

basically i was trying to make a "unified fabric" for the compute, storage and networking of 6-12 server boxes of anything from nvidia jetson or a raspberry pi, or a thinkpad with a broken screen.

Eventually i want to add like 1-2 cloud servers to practice horizontal scaling or adding flash-compute for like 24 hours to process batch jobs.

to accomplish this, i was gonna use a golang service on each machine, which orchestrates a bunch of VMs, containers and hardware bits like sensors, cameras, and my roomba. kinda like k8 but just for 10 servers instead of like 2000

like in the past, i used vercel, or stuff like [FLY.io](http://FLY.io), heroku, digital ocean, even AWS/GCS and they all had this shit taken care of.

But i want to try to roll my own devops/architecture/setup. I dont mind if it takes a long time to learn, i just want to get really good at making changes, especially the ones that would be unfeasible on cloud systems like AWS.

like all the startups can use the cloud cause they dgaf and are spending other peoples money and they have to get traction in 6 months or fail basically.

but i dont really have any goal or deadline.

and i think there are certain things you can do with self-hosted that are like 20-30x cheaper if you do it all locally, rather than in the cloud.

like at my previous job, we had services that managed like 50pb of data every day, and i did the math and itwas like 30k to do self hosted, but we were spending WAY more on aws

Specifically, i wanted to make something like "apple intelligence" but cross platform, 100% self hosted, open source, easier than apple, more secure than crowdstrike (because the data is 100% local, and the code is 100% yours so everyone can verify its security, rather than just who apple approves to audit them.) and has capabilities that companies wont really care about.

Also, I think robots will probably get cheaper, slowly, in the future, so i wanted to write some software to help homebrewers and hobbyists to make their own toy robots for 1000 - kinda like [http://nanosaur.ai/](http://nanosaur.ai/)

but i want both these things to be 100% FOSS and not corporate driven whatsoever, and easy enough to setup that your mom can do it. but that'll probably take 10 years.

  Comment: My *ideal* DNS / proxy / webserver setup?

Well I can't say I would argue against having local edge servers in every country in the world on single-digit anycast IPs using domains registered with my own registrar.... but my name isn't Larry Page nor is it Sergei Brin so can't really do that.

My current DNS setup is this: I have a 'hidden master' server (or several, for all you know) feeding data to public slaves from two different, independent anycast DNS providers. I don't use my registrars for DNS. I use manual nginx, none of that fancypants control panel stuff for all of my web servers. I sometimes use Cloudflare on websites I expect to get abused. I also have experimented with running varnish for caching. And behind my nginx is whatever stack I am experimenting with, be it nodejs, golang, crystallang, or whatever. Haven't done anything in python yet for web services, and haven't touched PHP in 9 years. But, otherwise, that's that.
