Post Content:
What approach do you recommend me to get started? I read about CasaOS and Umbrel, and appreciate the UI and app selection but I might still be limited in terms of app availability - for instance I could not host a personal blog there.

  
Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences!

  Comment: My advice, don't rush it. Just choose an OS and try and get familiar with it. Especially the security part if you plan on hosting a public website, exposing the Raspberry to the internet.





On any of the mentioned OSes you could probably host a blog/image host even if the app is not in gust selection. 




Docker compose could be a good and easy start.

  Comment: Trying to understand here OP, why did you bought rpi4 instead of 5 because both are nearly same price in market but rpi5 gives better performance

  Comment: Install Docker and Portainer. Then look on Docker Hub for applications you'd like. I personally install containers using Docker Compose yaml files which I also store in a Git repository for safe keeping.  

It's amazing how many applications can run on the Pi 4 comfortably.

There's a lot to learn but it's useful knowledge to have.

  Comment: I run all of this on an RPi 4, with the exception of QNAP and Obsidian, which are just links.

When running CPU-intensive tasks like processing new images on Immich and documents on Paperless, it does slow down a bit if I'm connected to it and working on other things. For the most part though, these are background operations that run and I don't pay attention to.

Are there "better" options out there? Yes, of course, depending on your use case. You said that this was a gift though, so I say make the most of it and learn.

  Comment: Give DietPi a try, couldn't recommend it enough for out of the box apps and for apps that they don't cover you always have docker and portainer.

You won't regret it, especially if you are starting your selfhosted journey.
