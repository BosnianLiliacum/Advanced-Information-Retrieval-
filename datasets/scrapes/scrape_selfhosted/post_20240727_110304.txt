yesterday I was playing with authentik container and I set it up in the default port 9000, when I put in nginx proxy manager to have an ssl and so on. I was greeted with connection error on the right hand side and connecting attempt (reconnecting). I do not know if anyone encountered the same before but any help would be appreciated.

  Comment: I've never used Authentik before but it may rely on websockets. In NPM you need to explicitly enable "Websockets Support" for the proxy host for websockets to work. I do think NPM should make that option enabled by default to avoid any issues like this.
