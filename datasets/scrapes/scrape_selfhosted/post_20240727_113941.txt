So there's something confusing me, i wonder how it works with users and services on an Ubuntu server 

I was looking into different ways to set up valheim server, found a guide on how to set one up as a service. Guide said to create a user called valheim and run it under there.

Now to my questions: can i make another user for example called valheim2 and run another server simultaneously? And even make a third user called vrise and run a third server for v rising at the same time?

And if i delete the user valheim2, does it remove everything affiliated with that server? And the others stay up and running?

And yeah, im aware of docker and all that. I just cant figure out the deal with users correctly

  Comment: The reason why they have you create another user is because it's best practice to not run services as root.

You can create as.many servers as you want as lony as you have the resources. 

What changes is the directory and port number. Youll still need to kill the server process and directory if you want to remove a server
