Post Content:
I would like to dith Grafana and Influxdb since it uses too much resources and the changes in the influx-syntax is a nightmare. 

  
What I would like to monitor: CPU usage of nodes, power usage of my TP-Link smart meters, some SNMP stuff and the most crucial part: which LXC/VM of my Proxmox host uses which resources (CPU, RAM, Bandwith). 

  
I would like to monitor several nodes and I would like to create my own "dashboard". 

  
What would you recommend?

Zabbix 

Observium 

Checkmk 

So many monitoring tools available just need to compare which suits the best for you.

  Comment: What is too much resources? Are you sure it's configured correctly? Mine influxdb2 instance is running on ancient hardware and is monitoring a lot more than yours yet cpu and ram usage are quite low.

  Comment: Victoriametrics is a drop-in replacement for the ingestion part, is lighter on resources and compatible with prometheus for the query part.  You have to change dashboards to use promql though. 

Depending on the amount of data,  you can consider the free grafana cloud tier.

  Comment: I thought I was coming to reccomend Glances and Dozzle for CPU and container monitoring, but maybe Home Assistant with MQTT would enable you to submit metrics and build a nice looking dashboard. 

Homepage ( [gethomepage.dev](http://gethomepage.dev) ) is pretty good as well for a dashboard.

  Comment: VictoriaMetrics + Grafana.

VictoriaMetrics can also ingest InfluxDB. So depending on your setup, that is an easy drop-in replacement.
