I use OpenVPN to connect back to my house when I am away from home. I have been using the OpenVPN Connect iOS app to do this, but the VPN doesn't always connect back home when I leave my home's WiFi network. I noticed that some VPN apps support the "On Demand" feature that allows you to specify specific SSIDs and/or scenarios where the VPN does not need to connect and, sadly, OpenVPN does not.

  
I was looking at  [Passepartout](https://passepartoutvpn.app/), but want to see if there are any other clients I should try before paying $10 for the On Demand support.

  
Does anybody have any recommendations for VPN Client iOS apps that support OpenVPN and On Demand?

  Comment: Tailscale (and Headscale if you want to go 100% self-hosted) supports VPN on demand but is Wireguard based instead of OpenVPN. In terms of performance this is actually a good thing, but I’m not sure if you have OpenVPN as a hard requirement.

I went to Tailscale from OpenVPN 2 years ago and haven’t looked back.
