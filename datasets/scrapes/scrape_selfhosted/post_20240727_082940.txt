Just wondering if there is any local self hosted versions of a logbook for this?  Most apps that I can see will pull from Strava, which I can setup an integration from Concept2 logbook, but, that is then 2 places that have all my data.  

Is there some self hosted version that will not have any of my data leave the house?

  Comment: I would be interested in this too actually. I don't particularly like the concept2 log site.
