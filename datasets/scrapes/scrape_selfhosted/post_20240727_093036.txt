I'm experiencing slow file transfer speeds between two computers (A &amp; B) located in different countries.  

Computer A: 100 Mbps download, 50 Mbps upload
Computer B: 50 Mbps download, 8 Mbps upload

Observations:

* **Syncthing:** Upload from A to B ~18-22 Mbps, upload from B to A ~7-8 Mbps.
* **iperf3:** TCP speeds are similar to Syncthing, but UDP is around 1 Mbps.
* **Virtual Network:** Tried Tailscale and OpenVPN through router interface, but speeds remained the same.



What could be causing these slow speeds, especially the significant difference in upload speeds between A to B and B to A?  Any suggestions for troubleshooting?


Edit: Set up a Syncthing client in the house of A in a Raspberry.
I can reach 50 Mbps of upload speed on that device between the computer B

Computer A and B are Windows 10

[SOLVED] 

I did an experiment and disable DNS (—accept-dns=false). And I can reach 50 Mbps upload now.

  Comment: I dont quite understand? It seems like this is because of computer B‘s slow upload, which likely is up to the ISP, or the specific speed Package you buy.

  Comment: You need to convert your ISP advertised speeds from Mbps to MBps which is what the transfer program appears to be measuring in.

They seem mostly correct once you do the conversion

  Comment: I have 2 disks, seagate 1.5tb hdd and samsung 870 ssd 2tb. One thing I have noticed over time was, when I try uploading any file to my Seagate hdd the upload speed varies between 15-25mbps (single large file) and the same file uploads at the speed of 100-110mbps to my samsung ssd.

One more thing, generally single large files upload faster than folder containing numerous small sized files.

Edit: The above results are from the systems located on same network.

This is expected behavior when computer A's upload rate is 50Mbps upload and computer B's upload rate is 8Mbps.
