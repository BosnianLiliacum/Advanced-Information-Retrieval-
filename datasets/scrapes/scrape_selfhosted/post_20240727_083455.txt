Anybody know any web based software which can be a CA and is used to issue certs for employees for document signing? This will only be self signed by the server but thats enough.

Most other solutions seem to focus on certs for SSL which is not what I need. Also document signing certs being a huge scam I don't want to pay anyone of those companies. Self signed is sufficient, I can just install the root CA to everyone who needs to use it in my work.
