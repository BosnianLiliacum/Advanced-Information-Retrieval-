Post Title: I just released Beszel, a server monitoring hub with historical data, docker stats, and alerts. It's a lighter and simpler alternative to Grafana + Prometheus or Checkmk. Any feedback is appreciated!

  Comment: I would like to see a tiny bit of `uptime kuma` incorporated just to check if a service responds on a port, http curl responds with 200, etc.

To make this my go to dashboard.

  Comment: GitHub repo: [https://github.com/henrygd/beszel](https://github.com/henrygd/beszel)

More info and instructions are available at the link above. It's intended to be as simple as possible, so you should be up and running in a few minutes.

As this is the first release, you may run into bugs. If you do, please let me know and I will fix them.

Additional features planned:

- Webhook option for alerts, so they can be hooked up to ntfy, pushover, mattermost, etc. As well as allowing users to specify a different email for alert delivery.

- Charts for network and disk I/O of docker containers.

Let me know if you have any other ideas.

  Comment: Just installed on all of my servers, gorgeous project, simple but also not simple. 

Enough metrics and oauth support and smtp alert, with backup can even auto generated and store in the s3 storage. 

Very polished and love it so much already, even more than my grafana+prometheus+node\_exporter or Netdata. 

Huge thanks to you and also starred the project already. I cannot wait to see this project to be thrived!

  Comment: Awesome work. I think you identified a good use case for the self hosting community, a simple server monitor running as a simple service. 
I will give it a go soon!

  Comment: Just installed this in my server and it looks great, way lighter than the whole prometheus/grafana/influxdb stack indeed. Great job! Thanks a lot for this.
