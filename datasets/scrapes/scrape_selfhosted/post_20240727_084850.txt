NexDNS was easy to setup. But lately they are acting weird. I'm consistently over 500k dns queries in a month and lots of drops and legitimate sites stops working. I'm leaning towards pihole. Any other alternatives worth considering?.

  Comment: If you're considering pihole, look into adguardhome and technitium dns too.

Both can do more than pihole, can act as native doh and dot server. Technitium can even be 100% self reliant dns server, having a copy of icann root zone locally.

Adguardhome is more modern looking and simple though, vs technitium old school ui with boatloads of different setting.

Just try both and decide for yourself.

  Comment: I setup AdGuard as main company DNS for a few thousand devices and its great. Highly recommend.

Client &gt; AdGuard &gt; bind authorative &gt; bind resolver

Works perfect. bind authorative are also the slaves of all ADs so that AD works too of course.
