  Comment: If you want to access your Wireguard from anywhere: Yes. It’s called port forwarding. Check your routers manual on how to do it.

  Comment: IIRC only one port is really needed to be forwarded(51820) but make sure you have a public ip, and make sure to only open ports you actually need to open(no reason to open a port to the internet if it is not needed)

  Comment: You have to yes, I have currently done it for three devices. My phone, laptop and work devices. So far I haven't had any issues and no sort of security breaches.

Keep in mind that I do observe my network overall and might act abit paranoid since I don't want people breaching my personal space.

A little sidenote, when connecting from another network into yours that sometimes the port of your current network might not allow it. This has happened to me at work before and I had to talk to my internal IT to allow the port.

  Comment: Yes you need to if you want people to correct from elsewhere

It's only the UDP port, not TCP. 51820 is the default iirc

How you would do it would depend on your network setup

  Comment: Yes. If it is on the router itself, then you just need to open the port for upd. If it's on a different system, then you'll need to forward the appropriate port from the router to that system.

  Comment: One nice feature is that it will silently discard packets that don't have the MAC header too.

  Comment: Should you?  Only if you want your VPN to work.

How to?  Look in your router/firewalls manual. Your looking for “port forwarding”
