i am currently new to this, i have ubuntu server installed and i have mounted a drive with my media into /home/user/media but when i go and search that folder into jellyfin i cant find it. I have tried reinstalling jellyfin, mounting and unmounting the drive to other folders but nothing works.

I would like some help

  Comment: Which user is running jellyfin?

You are more than likely having a permissions issue

The user accounts directory tend to have stricter permissions than other folders. 

Ideally it would be best to mount the external folder in somewhere like the /mnt directory
