I am setting up wireguard on my TP-link ER605 (2.2.5 Build 20240522 Rel.75860)router for the first time. I have access to internet but not local resources on subnet \`192.168.1.0\` Here is a pictures of my setup. Only thing blacked out is my public ip that I got using whatismyip .com. I have not forward any ports only because in tp-link doc it says nothing about that. I presume because wireguard is something you enable on this router via the vpn section. 

\* is there other settings I need to change to gain access to the local vlan network?

  
&gt; This is also posted in wireguard sub. But given there are more people here I thought I could get more troubleshooting help.

  Comment: I know nothing about this router so not sure if this comment will help 

Does this router have any firewall rules between subnets/VLANs?

You may need to allow the wireguard instance access to the subnet/VLAN that you want to access. 

Hope that helps
