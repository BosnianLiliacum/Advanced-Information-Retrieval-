  Comment: They opened an official forum when they closed the sub https://forum.jellyfin.org/

Also if you're using tmdb follow the naming convention Series Name (2018) [tmdbid-65567]

  Comment: At a quick glance I think you have your folder name incorrect. Which might be why it's being problematic. Your file names look correct, Jellyfin follows the same standard as Plex for naming and my stuff shows up correctly in Plex. 

You have your folder name as "Kaiju No. 8 (423075)" when it should be "Kaiju No. 8 (2024)". The number in parenthesis is the year that show came out, not the tmdb id. 

That could be why its having issues.

Or just use Plex, because it just works. Often times even if your format is slightly off, Plex still correctly finds and scans your show and episodes in. 

I know Plex gets a lot of hate, but this is one of the many reasons I still use it over Jellyfin.

  Comment: Whats with that jumble of letters in the parenthesis of Kaiju no. 8? That could be your issue.

I run with just Kaiju no. 8 (2024) and it works fine for me. I run both Plex and Jelly.

Ideally you would use something like exactly how the doc's show, &lt;tmbid-41341&gt; would be for shows that have similar names and start dates.

The basic premise is: &lt;show name&gt; (&lt;year&gt;)

  Comment: SHOWNAME - (YEAR) -&gt; [https://imgur.com/Uwf5BlH](https://imgur.com/Uwf5BlH)  
or  
SHOWNAME - (YEAR) \[tvdbid-1234\]

help yourself and start using sonarr and maybe radarr (https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/), they are huge help even for stupid renaming ;)
