So i have an assortment of disks i want to use in my homelab. This is where i need to locate the storage:

Main proxmox server, one disk for OS, one for VM's, and rest for storage to nextcloud immich etc

Raspberry pi, restic docker backups, i have a 2tb usb-c drive for this

Proxmox backup server, one disk for OS, rest for backups

The disks i have are these:

3x 1TB M.2 NVMe SSDs

3x 1TB HDDs

1x 2TB USB-C SSD (for Raspberry Pi)

1x 2TB HDD

3x 250gb ssd's

1x 525gb ssd

The m.2's, and the 2tb hdd's are in pretty good conditions. And the others are in fine conditions. When it comes to using RAID, i dont think i care that much other than for the disks that are in fine condition.

Anyone have any good ideas on how to sort this out?

  Comment: I'm not 100% sure what information you're looking to receive. I'd use only SSDs for OS/VMs. Which disk size to assign for each will vary based on what type of VMs (and number of VMs) you'll be running and their disk size requirements.

As far as a RAID solution, considering the varying sizes of the disks, mergerfs/snap raid may be of interest to you.
