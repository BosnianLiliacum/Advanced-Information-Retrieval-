Hello,

I am occassionally recording podcasts and I am interested in self hosted solution that does following:

* 4 people sit at their homes, in front of their browsers.
* One of them (the admin) sends a custom generated link to all of them, which they click on.
* All of them are now connected through their audio. Each of them hears the remaining 3.
* They can chat for however long they want (usually less than 3 hours).
* At the end, there are 4 separate WAV files (one for each participant), ready to download by admin to mix them into a podcast.

There are MANY solutions available online for this (e.g. [cleanfeed.net](http://cleanfeed.net), [podcastle.ai](http://podcastle.ai), [riverside.fm](http://riverside.fm) ) but all of them have artificial limitations unless you pay monthly, e.g.:

* The audio recording time is capped at 2 hours or less.
* The downloaded audio is not full CD quality uncompressed WAV but low quality MP3.
* The downloaded audio is a single WAV with all participants mixed into a single channel.

I have my own public Ubuntu Linux server which I am able to install anything on. I was googling for 30 minutes but I was unable to find a simple application which does JUST the above and does not require me to install complex databases, webservers, frameworks, certificates etc...
