Where would be a good server location for my small but global toy project? Of course, it would be nice to have a multi-region infrastructure, but I can't afford it haha.

If you could only choose one region, where would it be? Umm... I'm in LA, so I think at least three places in Europe, the US, and East Asia shouldn't have too much latency, but I'd like some feedback on my decision.

  Comment: Hypothetically: US east (if most probable visitors are from US), otherwise Frankfurt.

In reality: wherever you want, and put it behind Cloudflare for free

  Comment: Closest to wherever most of the users will be to, rest will just have to deal with it. But I'd except for a small hobby project latency wouldn't really matter all that much at the end of the day anyway. And I guess there's something like Cloudflare that does just-about-free CDN that you could throw on it if you really want to.

  Comment: I'd also say Frankfurt or US East as thhose are some quite central points and a lot (really a lot) of Datacenters are in Germany.

  Comment: If there's any concern about the host country requiring you to hand over data about your users, you may want to consider a country that isn't in the 5/9/14 Eyes alliances. That makes Switzerland one of the better options.

If you don't care about that, just consider what regions most of your users will be in and try to place it as central to those locations as possible.
