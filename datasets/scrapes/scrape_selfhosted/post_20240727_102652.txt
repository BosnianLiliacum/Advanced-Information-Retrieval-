Hi, 

  
I set up my self hosted HTTPS server. problem is if an outage happens, or if the system crashes, it asks for a login and eventually sleeps.

I was wondering if there is a way to auto login only when the computer is turned on, not removing remote login or SSH via password. anyone can help?

  Comment: When you say "asks for login" do you mean you are running a graphical environment on the server?

If so, you can enable auto login (depends on your DE / login screen for specific steps required). That will just log in to the graphical session, you can still log in via ssh.

Separately -- why are you using a graphical install if you're just running a server? Most distros have a "server" variant that is CLI only since it's assumed you'll just use ssh or something rather than sitting at it with KB+M. Ubuntu has Ubuntu Server for example I think.
