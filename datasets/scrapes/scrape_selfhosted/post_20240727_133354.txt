Hey, I'm looking at making a relatively powerful home server for hosting game servers, Plex/Jellyfin (transcoding etc.) and other software. I assume a GPU would be beneficial in this, in case I ever want a DE and for the whole transcoding portion (+ Immich ML). Would you guys recommend simply putting in a cheap 3050?

  Comment: At least for media transcoding, you're better off with QuickSync on a recent-gen Intel CPU than you are using a GPU.  Cheaper and much more efficient to run for the same performance.

  Comment: A GPU won't help with the game server portion but for transcoding, either get a modern Intel CPU for QSV or, if for whatever reason you don't like Intel CPU's, get an A310 GPU

  Comment: For transcoding, QSV is probably the better option. Especially if you'll be hosting a game server which I assume to mean streaming gameplay to remote devices. I'm recalling something about a low limit on active NVENC streams on most NVIDIA GPU's (like 5 or something) - and this allotment is likely to be shared between encodes for media and active game sessions. Additionally, if you want to host any local AI models a GPU seems to be a semi-requirement.

So a GPU is a good idea for some things you might want to do. But transcoding may be better served by an Intel CPU with QSV

  Comment: I am running fine with a 1060 6GB for Immich and Jellyfin 4K transcoding. Small LLMs in Ollama perform okay as well. Stay with Nvidia, I tried AMD and it was so much hustle to get running.

  Comment: If it’s just about video (not ML), how about an Intel Arc GPU? Quickync. AV1. Small. Cheap.

  Comment: Simply getting a server to RDP or VNC while using a GPU to speed it up has been almost impossible.  I have an old 1080 I threw in a server to see if I could get it to work and it still isn't working right almost a year later.  I got it sorta working with TurboVNC but even that's started not launching correctly.

Of course this could be just me, I'm not a very good sysadmin.

The instructions I came across last year when I was working at it heavily said that nVidia was much harder to get working because it's hard to get it to use a virtual frame buffer and it doesn't work right if a monitor isn't connected.

This may or may not be pertinent to your situation.

Otherwise, I'm running Ark, Valheim and Minecraft servers all the time without the GPU really doing anything and having no issues whatsoever using an AMD 5900X.  Usual use is 2 valheim servers and a minecraft server and then also other random household stuff without any slowdowns anyone's noticed.

  Comment: If you want non gaming stuff related gpu, then weakest gpu is fine, but it has to be the latest generation. So i recommend not 3050 but rather 4060. Due to the better nvenc chip. 4070 and higher uses 2 nvenc chip if you wanna do more powerful stuff.
