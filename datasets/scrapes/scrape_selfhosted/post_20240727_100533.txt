Post Content:
Presenting Syncio, an open-source tool designed for:

✅ Minimal setup

✅ Platform independence

✅ Fast, wireless file transfers

✅ File transfer over Hotspot or LAN

Built with Go, HTML, and Bootstrap, Syncio aims to make on-the-go wireless file transfers as smooth as possible.

The primary motivation behind building this was the lack of easy to use file sharing options in Linux-Android and Mac-Android ecosystems.

✨ Any contributions and feedback are welcome. Give it a try and let me know your thoughts!

  Comment: Thank you for your work, I'll give it a try !
I love go and the fact it's just one executable which makes it trivial to test and/or put in container.

If you want your project to grow in popularity, I think you will have to give some docker instructions even if it's just a 2 lines Dockerfile ans docker compose. If not, you will lose people only trying containers.

If it's just for fun, let it like this, one exec is already really convenient.

  Comment: Looks good but I think you should add a docker image to run it

  Comment: Genuine question to everyone asking for a docker image, What exactly do you need a docker image for?

Running the exe or building from source?

Also if anyone wants to contribute by creating the docker image, you're most welcome
