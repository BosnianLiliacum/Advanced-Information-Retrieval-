Hi All,

I have a fairly hefty ZFS setup across multiple pools in ProxMox currently.  I like it directly in ProxMox and don't want to move the ZFS into any VM's/Containers, just mount disks on them.

I do this at the moment with TrueNas inside a VM.  When I originally set this up, it wasn't using ZFS for underlying storage, but now it is.  So whilst I have ZFS features disabled inside TrueNas, it's still ZFS on ZFS.

What do I need?

 - SMB Share Capability WITH LDAP Integration

 - NFS Share Capability

That's literally it.  OpenMediaVault looked promising until I got to LDAP which is a burning pile of failure.  Id also rather not directly share from the ProxMox host.

I haven't ever setup shares just from a basic Linux VM, but I'm guessing this might be the way to go, though the thought of LDAP via it going haywire gives me cause for concern (*not because of the tech, but because I have to google almost everything Linux related)*.

Thanks!

  Comment: I use NFS for all linux VMs, it works fine. I also run some windows hosts, and I found sshfs for windows pretty smooth that I use for those. Could probably use sshfs for linux as well, but dont know how reliable that would be and I havent tried it.

  Comment: TurnKey Linux File Server template. Bind mount a folder on your ZFS pool, then create SMB/NFS shares. Works great, I replaced a TrueNAS VM with this.
