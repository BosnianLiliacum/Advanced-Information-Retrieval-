  Comment: Doubt theres any that would yolo gives access to root server without any kyc whatsoever. Thats like them begging to host script kiddies, brute forcers, malware c&amp;c etc.

If you're that desperate, prepaid debit cards mostly works too unless you're a 13yo can't even legally own cards.

  Comment: There are a few providers out there that let you pay with Bitcoin. A quick search will pull up some, and then you choose if they are real/safe enough for what you need.

  Comment: No such thing exists. Allowing people to anonymously use server capacity will just lead to such a service being flooded with cryptominers.
