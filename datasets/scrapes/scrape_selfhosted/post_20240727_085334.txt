I currently own a raspberry pi 4, but since I found it to be too limited for my selfhosting needs, I'm looking into upgrading to better hardware.

This is what I'm planning on hosting:

- File storage with raid 1 (two drives)
- Nextcloud (barely usable on rpi4)
- Jellyfin mediaserver (working on rpi4 with no transcoding)
- tvheadend (working on rpi4 with no transcoding)
- paperless-ngx for document management (with OCR)
- Immich for photo management (with local ai features for subject detection, and so on)

I'm planning on connecting to my home network via wireguard (supported by router) and to not expose anything publically. I was thinking about upgrading to an RPI5, but the h264 hardware decoder seems to have been removed, and I'm not sure if the performance difference is as significant as I want it to be. 
I was also thinking about going with a more high powered arm device like a banana pie or something like an Intel Nuc or synology, but I can't decide on what would suit me best. I don't mind a technical challenge and am not necessarily looking for something that "just works".

Unfortunately, electricity is quite expensive where I live, so a low idle power draw is important to me. I'd appreciate any suggestions!

  Comment: What about something like the Aoostar N100 PC? https://aoostar.com/products/aoostar-r1-2bay-nas-intel-n100-mini-pc-with-w11-pro-lpddr4-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd

Might be a bit pricey, but it sounds almost exactly like what you're looking for.

  Comment: I switched from Pi 4 to Lenovo ThinkCentre M920 SFF. I felt it's kinda overkill for me. My rent covers electricity, so I really never bothered. Just got the PC for CA$200 and bought 2x 8GB DDR4 from the marketplace. 


I switched to proxmox and I'm in love. 


On my Pi 4, I was running arr stack including jellyfin with transcoding, worked like a charm. I was running Ubuntu Server with Docker for all the services.
