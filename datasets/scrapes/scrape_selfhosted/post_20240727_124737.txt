I'm looking at things like:

Baserow

Nocodb

Tooljet

Lowcoder

And even tho all of them are free and open source, it seems that most of their features are behind a paywall.

I'm looking for something extremely basic to create a simple excel like app (all of the mentioned solutions can do this) - but i cannot assign different permissions to different users, unless i buy the paid versions.
