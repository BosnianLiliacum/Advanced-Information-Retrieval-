Hello everyone!
I have databases, and often I need generate excel files for my users. I need plataform, where I can write simple web ui for customization SQL query with filters (dates, storages, clients, etc.) for end users, where they can download result of SQL query to Excel (or CSV). I don't need CRUD abilities, only Read (export to excel).
Better, if project was on Python, and more better, if users can generates excel with formulas.
Do you know exists projects? Even in alpha stages.

Thanks.

  Comment: Metabase or apache superset. They're more like dashboard. 


Streamlit or gradio for simple python low code.

  Comment: I wrap an app that does that in .net, but, did it for my work, so, can't exactly give the source there.

But- really easy to do with python. Willing to bet chatgpt would get you 95% of the way there with python.

  Comment: Check out SQLAlchemy and Pandas in Python for exporting SQL to Excel with customizable queries. You can create a simple web UI using Flask for your users to filter and download results. Also, for creating visual documentation for your team, I highly recommend Guidde  its been a lifesaver for making how-to videos quickly.

  Comment: Does it have to be Excel?  Why not Grafana / Prometheus?  Then the users get pretty charts and a lot of customization, and you could stand it up a lot faster than rolling your own solution.  If I recall correctly, end users can do Grafana =&gt; CSV with a few clicks if they really want.

  Comment: Write some Perl, Python, or PHP (yes, it can run in a shell, not just for web), etc to pull the data to write your spreadsheet.

  Comment: I wrote an old project that let users feed a sql script or stored proc and allowed user to export to a csv, excel or txt flat file.   
python cli with a .net desktop app (this was for user in a ms office world)   
I recently started to redo the front end all in python but it's a slow slog and im in no hurry. 

Only one release but may be able to help you out. [link](https://github.com/eddyizm/flatfileexporter)
