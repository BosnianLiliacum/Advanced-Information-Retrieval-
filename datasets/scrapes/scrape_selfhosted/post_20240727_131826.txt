next weekend we have a party with our association where volunteers sell food and drinks for a good cause. they now want a calculator where they can simply count different items up and down with +/- and where the total price comes out at the end. we don't need a payment function, just the calculation function. unfortunately i don't have the search words for google. does anyone have a hot tip for a self-hosted software?

  Comment: With Grocy you could create the items, assign them a price and get the total sum.


Its not the intended usage, but It would work

  Comment: I put your comment verbatim into chatgpt and it gave me a working website with what you need. The only thing missing is a reset button.

  Comment: What you want is a simple order form, any self hosted ecommerce platform can do this - wordpress has a million ecommerce plugins. The trick is to create a coupon that deducts 100% of the price on checkout - in some systems a couple code can be as simple as a 1.

The easycart wp plugin has the +/- buttons you are asking for: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-easycart/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-easycart/)

If this is too complicated for your liking, github has a several results for order form; this one looks super easy to modify - just need to update the order.js file with your own list of products: [https://github.com/h-yung/website-cafe](https://github.com/h-yung/website-cafe)

  Comment: This is something you could knock up in Vite/Vue in just an hour or two, and dockerise to run it self hosted. I'd offer to do it myself as a bit of dev practice but I've got covid brain fog :(
