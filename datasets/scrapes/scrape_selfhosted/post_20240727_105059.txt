Hi, I enjoy playing old video games through emulators, but struggle to maintain all of the emulators and files across different devices.

I have an old Raspberry Pi, and wondered if there is any selfhosted software I could set up to assist with this? I would like to

- store and organise game and save files
- emulate a variety of machines 
- stream to various devices

Does a solution for this exist? It doesn't need to be all in one

Thanks!!

  Comment: Surprised nobody mentioned [RomM](https://github.com/rommapp/romm), it’s pretty much exactly what you’re looking for. It acts as a web-based ROM manager for all your systems, and even PC games. You can also use the built-in EmulatorJS functionality to play games on whatever devices can load up the page.

Really awesome for management, and it’s currently what I’m using to organize my collection.

  Comment: Everything up to the last point, there’s nothing that exists that self hosts and then streams to other devices. Your best bet is check out Launchbox, I have used it for years as a single device emulator and it covers virtually every platform known to man!

  Comment: you can self host [webrcade](https://github.com/webrcade/webrcade) and it plays n64/ps1 and older via a web browser. your gamesaves are stored to the device you connect to, however you can login to dropbox and sync gamesaves between devices.

the local device's web browser runs the emulator, but you grab the emulator/rom from the server. it was my go to web based emulator for a while, play on my phone while mobile, hop on my xbox and load up edge, jump over to my desktop and my gamesaves were all shared. i never selfhosted it so all i needed to do was just load in the feed url and login to dropbox.
