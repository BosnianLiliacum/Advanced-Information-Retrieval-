Hi,

  
we had been using puzzle.aggie.io for quite a while for multiplayer puzzling but that service recently went down then back up and now down again.

Mainly for that reason but also because I'd prefer hosting it myself I've been looking into finding a self-hostable alternative but have not been able to find anything in that regard yet. If any of y'all could help I'd appreciate it.

Ideally the service should offer

- Custom image upload

- Variable piece size (up to a few thousand)
