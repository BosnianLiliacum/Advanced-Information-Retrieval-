Hello,

I've been running DietPi for some time now and really do enjoy it. I mainly use it for Plex and the various apps surrounding Plex using Docker to containerize them.

  
I'm about to rebuild my Pi and I'm trying to decide on whether to go with DietPi again or try an alternative such as Swizzin.

  
I was just wondering if anyone out there has used both, what are the pros/cons for Swizzin vs DietPi?

  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

  
Thankyou!
