I've been trying to get kasm to authenticate through Authentik using  oidc. I've set everything up following the docs. But when I try to log in to kasm after clicking the Authentik button all I get in an "Internal Error"message. Logs on either server don't seem to show anything either. 

Has anyone sense seen or had luck with this? 

Thanks!

Try to set SAML following this guide, maybe you will get some luck.
