Maybe I imagined it, but I thought a few months or so ago I saw someone mention a service that allows you to create a single button on a webpage that can run a command on the host machine. e.g. so I could create a button that just runs “sudo shutdown now”, for example. That way when I need to turn off my Docker host remotely, I can do so just using my phone, rather than having to go to my computer, turn that on, log into my Docker host via SSH, and then shut it down. 

Is this a thing?

  Comment: There are SSH apps for iPhone and android so you dont necessarily need to use your computer. But to answer your question, something like Olivetin ?

Edit: you could also make your own app, would take very minimal knowledge in something like python and html. ChatGPT could code that up in a single prompt.
