Hello r/selfhosted fam,

I wanted to know if anyone use Joplin with Apple ipad or samsung tab or any other tab ? How is your experience and feedback ? Do pencil/pen work well with Joplin ?

Thanks

  Comment: You're probably better off posting on the Joplin subreddit, where you will find more people who use the app. r/joplinapp

  Comment: I use it on a windows computer, a macbook pro, and an ipad. I don't think it supports the apple pencil as I haven't gotten it to work.

  Comment: I use it on iOS and Mac but only the text modes. The self-hosted sync server is definitely the way to go over its other sync options.
