Post Content:
[Readeck](https://readeck.org/), a bookmarking tool written in go, seems to have its docker image and source code served exclusively through [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/), which seems to be blocked in my region for reasons I don't understand. I was able to verify that it's a regional block by opening the website in Tor.

Readeck developer(s) have no email address, and codeberg just doesn't respond. Any ideas how to tell the devs to upload to another service too? 

If the devs see this... please upload another copy to docker hub.

Do you guys use it?

&gt; Is there a system to store my (paywall) website credentials?

&gt; There isn't, for several reasons: 

&gt;- It's borderline illegal, 

&gt; ... 

WAT? :/

  Comment: Use this. Run `docker load -i filename` https://send.mni.li/download/f17c79b0a9146c97/#ULGZcCySI7qxO7jchsHPsw
