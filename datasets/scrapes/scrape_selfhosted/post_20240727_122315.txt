I am struggling to find an application that would be able to look at a specific directory, and be able to swap a file while backing up the files so no data is lost. I want this for swapping save files in a game with limited slots, and I would like to not have to do this manually every time. The game is Monster Hunter: World, if that helps.

Putting it as simply as I can, I want the application to:  
Look at the folder where the game saves are stored  
Create a copy of the save in a designated folder for back ups  
Move a different save file to the save directory  
Back up the moved file for safety

If this is the wrong subreddit to look for an application like this, I apologize. If any one who sees this knows of a better subreddit to post this, please share.

On windows use power shell script, on Linux, bash script

  Comment: I mean, the two solutions you can do yourself are copy the saves manually or with a script (possibly renaming them?), or using git.  If you're a coder or interested in code git is absolutely a tool worth learning...but if not it can be a bit much to learn.

If you want something more specific for this, I'll defer to others.
