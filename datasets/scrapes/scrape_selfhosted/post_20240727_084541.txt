I recently started a blog detailing my self-hosted setup, primarily focused on media servers.

If you're running an ebook or music server, you might find some useful tips or even some new ideas to enhance your setup.

In the blog, I plan to cover:

* How to set up and manage ebook and music servers.
* Tips for organizing and optimizing your digital library.
* Custom applications I created to improve server functionality and management.
