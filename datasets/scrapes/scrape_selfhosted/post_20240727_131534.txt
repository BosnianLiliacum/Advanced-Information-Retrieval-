I've been reviewing the TRaSH Guides, and I've been planning on setting up a more efficient media server using my existing media. A big thing I am interested in is replacing duplicate files on the same volume with hardlinks, for example replacing media in the Jellyfin folder with hardlinks. I'd be saving a good amount of storage space if I replaced a duplicate video file with a hardlink instead of having two identical video files in different places on the volume.

  
A while back when I first started working on more homelab projects, I decided to use BTRFS for my drives. With this, they support the file-based deduplication tool "Duperemove". At the same time, the TRaSH Guides recommend using jdupes for replacing existing files with hardlinks.

  
In this scenario, would it be better to stick with BTRFS's Duperemove, or to use jdupes as mentioned in the TRaSH Guides to deduplicate media?

  Comment: I would address the issue of duplicate files first. Why do you have a movie multiple times in different folders?

  Comment: Don't they both perform the same block-level deduplication? jdupes has an option for this.

  Comment: Duperemove is actually not a btrfs feature. it's a 3rd parrty tool for XFS and btrfs  

The gentoo wiki has a pretty good top level explainer on it

  Comment: I wrote jdupes. I'm biased. It's not perfect. It occasionally has hiccups but mostly works as expected. If you have issues please email me. Use whatever you are more comfortable with.
