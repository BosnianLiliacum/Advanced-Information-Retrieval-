Hello everyone,

I am migrating from a barebone installation to proxmox and I use fireflyIII (through docker) to monitor my financial condition.

I want to transfer the existing installation from my old server to the new one. How it will be best to do it?

I tried exporting all the transactions in CSV and tried to use firefly importer but it keeps throwing import errors.

Any ideas?

  Comment: Can’t you just copy the docker firefly volume?

Can you clarify your situation. Is the current working instance installed on bare metal? Or is the current working instance utilizing docker?

If the current working instance is utilizing docker on the old machine, you should be able to copy all volumes that are associated with the docker compose/ docker image and migrate that to the new server (ensure it is in the exact location that is defined in the docker compose/ docker command and has the exact same permissions)

This is why people utilize docker, for easy migration 

Hope that helps

  Comment: stop the container, use tar to make an archive of the old container incl all the folders for config, data etc.

copy the archive to the new computer/vm and untar it.

start the container (new computer)

  Comment: Thank you all for commenting.

I deleted the folder and copies anew all the contents from the old server to the new one. This time, everything was there. 🙏🏻
