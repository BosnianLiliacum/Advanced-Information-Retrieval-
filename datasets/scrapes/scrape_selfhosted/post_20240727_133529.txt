Hello,



I am looking for a webapp where I can enter all the information that I can then search for again when I need it. 

e.g. windshield wiper is in the basement, Chris has 39 degrees fever ibuprofen given or Tapo socket is in the chest of drawers



I'm not directly looking for an inventory, rather a form in which I can enter information that I can retrieve later.



I hope I have explained it so that it can be understood.

in my opinion i have already seen a similar webapp here or in the selfhosted list. but i can't find it

  Comment: I was looking for something similar recently, and came across [flatnotes](https://github.com/dullage/flatnotes). It opens up with a search bar, which seems to be what you're looking for.

Here's a good list of note-taking apps that was put together by /u/Temporary_Delay9456 a few months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1bs8uzh/self_hosted_note_taking_app/kxgi70l/

I'll also throw in a couple other options:

* [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/)

* [Note Mark](https://notemark.docs.enchantedcode.co.uk/about/)

* [Meemo](https://github.com/cloudron-io/meemo)
