  Comment: Hello,

Any J4125/N5095/N100 chinese NUC should be way powerfull and some times cheaper than Rpi.

You can check on Beelink, Trigkey, Chatreey and other brands that are based on the same hardware but with different stickers.

  Comment: N100 mini PCs with good specs and low price. (new)  
And semi-recent thin clients, like HP T540/T640. (used)

Oh, and I've got an Odroid H4+ (N97) on the way with the 3.5" enclosure to replace my janky Asrock N100-DC ITX NAS setup.

  Comment: I just saw that radxa is about to release/ did release the radxa x4. It's a pi sized SBC that has an n100 on it. Similar price to a pi. I want one.

  Comment: I've switched mainly to Intel (Asus) NUCs. Only run pihole and homeassistant on my 2 pi's. Have 2 NUCs running, one as a development/playground with proxmox and a  "production" machine running Ubuntu with most of my applications

  Comment: I have used Libre Le Potato for about a year. It runs pihole, tailscale, some backup space and some other stuff. The big bottleneck is 100mbit ethernet. I plan to get the Renegade with 1Gbit ethernet at some point. 2GB version is \~30 USD + 10USD for 16GB eMMC storage.

  Comment: With the price of Pis now, they really don't make sense when you can get a micro/mini PC second hand on eBay and it is upgradeable, it is x86, and more powerful.
