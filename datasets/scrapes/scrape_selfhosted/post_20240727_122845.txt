Hey!

I currently help out some friends with their just released selfhosted Alpha version of their Idle game. I hope it´s ok to post it here. It´s somewhat similar to Hamster Kombat, only with far less budget but with a real human designer and a really cool, motivating story and a lot of features planed for the Beta, e.g. blockchain connection, AI-based business incidents that make the game experience unique to each single player and some other blockchain related feats. The current version is just a first playable "Hello" to the world. It´s build with Unity and Firebase database in the back. Would be fantastic to get some feedback. Atm, it´s just for Android users but as far as I know, iOS should follow in September. 

The link to a little more explanation and in case you wanna give it a try to download the APK: [https://www.smartmoney-game.io/alpha/](https://www.smartmoney-game.io/alpha/)
