I'm looking for a solution similar to Codeium's remote indexing feature, but preferably one that works locally. My goal is to create an AI assistant with up-to-date knowledge of specific frameworks by using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on GitHub repositories.Ideal workflow:

1. Pull 4-5 relevant GitHub repos
2. Convert repos into searchable indexes
3. Attach these indexes as a knowledge base to an AI assistant
4. Query the AI assistant normally, leveraging the indexed repo information

Current options I've explored:

* Supermaven: Indexes repos but only uses context for autocompletion, not chat
* Amazon Q: Recently added similar feature, but limited to the current working repo
* Codeium remote indexes: Promising but enterprise-only and likely expensive

Key requirements:

* Local solution preferred
* Ability to index multiple repos (indexing takes \~20 minutes per repo)
* Use indexed data as context for AI assistant responses
* Maintain fresh, token-efficient knowledge base

Has anyone implemented a similar setup or know of tools that could help achieve this? I'm open to using existing solutions or guidance on building a custom implementation. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!
