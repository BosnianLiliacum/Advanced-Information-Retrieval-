Post Content:
Anyone know of a barebones web-based issue/ticket system? No fancy UI or backend. Just plain HTML.

Edit: Also note that it should be able to work as a public facing service.

  Comment: I don't know if that's barebone enough for you, but I can't recommend Hesk enough (https://www.hesk.com/). It's free, open-source, self-hostable, and relatively lightweight. I've deployed it a few times in both personal and professional contexts, and the amount of features it includes is pretty insane.
