Im trying to setup a sms gateway that has smpp. Im using a service that sends alerts via sms. But i need a provider for this. But id rather setup my own gateway for the provider to connect to me.

Ive looked around and see a few. But im unsure if what im wanting to do can be done?

Looks like i can get a modem and a sim card to proceed?

  Comment: Unless you are sending thousands of messages per day, the cost of having your own gateway will be far greater than paying a third party. 

Even major corporations do it. Ever see a OTP come from the same number as another company? That is because they are using the same third party.

VoIP.ms seems to offer support for it.
