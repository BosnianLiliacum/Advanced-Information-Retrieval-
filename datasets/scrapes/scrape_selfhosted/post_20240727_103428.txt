This server is running Proxmox, but I've found a weird issue. The server is connected to a switch through its Ethernet port on the *motherboard.* However when I removed a spare *PCIe* Ethernet adaptor card, it was disconnected from the local network, and the light on the switch went out. After that, I placed the adaptor card in again, and everything worked.  
(I tried both ports on my motherboard and both have the same issue)

Also, another interesting is that the light on the switch goes out only after the server boots, and as soon as the server shuts down, the connection automatically reformed.

    Hardware Info:
    CPU: Xeon E5-2670 (x1)
    Motherboard: Asus P9X79 WS
    Mentioned adaptor card: Realtek RTL8111

  Comment: Your network interfaces will sometimes be renamed after you add or remove pcie devices.

You can get the list of interfaces with a simple \`ip a\` command and then take note of your current interface names. Replace the old value with the new value in \`/etc/network/interfaces\`

Then you can reboot of bring down and back up the bridge that uses that interface.
