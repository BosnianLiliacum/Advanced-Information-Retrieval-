Hey r/selfhosted,

Our company has decided to open source Towerify, an internal tool designed to manage a fleet of YunoHost servers. This tool simplifies the configuration, deployment, and monitoring of servers, leveraging YunoHost, Osquery, and Vanilo to create a seamless admin experience. Whether you're managing one server or several, Towerify aims to make the process straightforward and accessible for admins of all skill levels.

For more details and to try it out, check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/computablefacts/towerify). Hope you find it useful for your self-hosted setups!

  Comment: Pretty cool, I didn't realize that YunoHost is still a big deal to the point that people have fleets of them deployed.

  Comment: It has taken me so long to work out what a YunoHost is that I no longer care for your product. When did people stop saying what their software is or does?
