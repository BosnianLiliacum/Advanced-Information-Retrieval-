I was installing the homepage dashboard into my portainer and went to fix the services.yaml folder with the setup the site provides. After editing that I went back to homepage but all I see is "

# Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information).Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information)."

  
What could be the issue here? i made sure my services.yaml file was correct too
