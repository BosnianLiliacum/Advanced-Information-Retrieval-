Post Content:
I use Pihole and was curious about AdGuard - most of the comparisons are  ~50/50 (= it does not really matter which one you use). 

In the pure "fix it until you beak it" philosophy, I am tempted to try AdGuard and was wondering if it has a few more advanced features I use in Pihole:

- ability to run parallel upstrem DNS requests (`all-servers` in `dnsmasq`)
- use DHCP options such as 42 (NTP) or classless static routes

I would appreciate some feedback for those who run AdGuard already

  Comment: Yes adguardhome can parallel query upstream. Not sure about dhcp. Can even be paired with local bind9 axfr-ing icann root zone for your setup to be 100% locally self reliant doesn't need remote upstream at all. Adguardhome can also natively act as doh and dot server, which i believe pihole can't?

Theres also technitium dns that can act as authoritative natively, no need bind9 at all to be 100% locally self reliant.

  Comment: I ran Pihole for about six months and hit the issue of needing a second instance of it up and running on my network due to reboots, outages, etc and not getting resolution. Then I brought a second instance of it up and I needed to keep the two in sync. I didn't care for the way Gravity Sync worked, it just didn't work for me. I know people that use it and love it.

I switched to two Adguard instances, both sync'd with https://github.com/bakito/adguardhome-sync and it's worked great for me.

  Comment: I can't speak to your bullet points specifically, but I just switched to it a few days ago after running pihole for a couple of years. Nothing wrong with pihole, I just wanted to try AdGuard.

The interface feels lighter and easier to navigate. Wildcard redirects are quick to implement. The default block list seems to catch quite a bit more vs the pihole default.

  Comment: You should just try it anyway. Easy to set up. Throw Technitium into the mix while you're at it.

  Comment: AdGuard and Pi-Hole are similar programs and do pretty much the same thing with slightly different features,   
AdGuard is written in Go so it's just a single binary vs  
Pi-Hole is written in PHP so it has a ton of dependencies.    
  
  
If you really want more advanced settings look at Technitium  
https://technitium.com/dns/  
  
  
I think a lot of people go from Pi-Hole, to AdGuard, to Technitium as they want "more" from there DNS server/ad blocker (simple evolution)  
  
  
As amazing as Pi-Hole was when it came out 10ish years ago in 2024 Pi-Hole seems very much like a project of a bygone era (no support for DoH or DoT).
