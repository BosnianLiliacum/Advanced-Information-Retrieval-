I tried some cloud VM on oracle but my game don't run on their CPU. If I want to try for fun to open ports and port forwarding my router to make a public Astroneer server with my home wifi. Is it dangerous? I don't think I would be able to start with the Vlan and advanced security things. I might just open some ports and install a server with AMP. I don't know what I am doing I might get hacked right? I don't want hackers to get into my home devices or online banking or see my personal data etc. maybe this is bad idea?

  Comment: Hosting game servers over WiFi will at best lag a lot, more probably cause a lot of disconnects for the players

  Comment: if your game doesn't run on their cpu, you need to use an instance type with a supported cpu.
for example, if you're running a binary built for x64, you need an x64 cpu on the instance type.

same with a binary built for aarch64, you need an arm cpu.
