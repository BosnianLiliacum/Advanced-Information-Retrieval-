I read some posts about self hosting DNS server. It's really very confusing. Such posts only use DNS word again and again and do not specify which DNS server?

First, there are two types of DNS server we can selfhost- 
Recursive DNS (client computer uses it to translate domain name to IP. It gets IP from Authoritative DNS)

Authoritative DNS (storing DNS records, with an exception of NS records maintained at registrar website).

...................................

Now there are two recursive DNS IP are stored in network settings of operating system of client computer.

For domain name, there are also two Authoritative DNS.


For selfhosting, what are the requirements-
Will I need two IP?
Will I need two static IP? Or dynamic IP will work.

If dynamic IP will work, then how it will change automatically in my network settings of client computer OS.



1.
Should I self host Recursive DNS? Or jus use one that ISP aasigns by default to device. Or use Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 plus 1.0.0.1 for speed.

If I should self host Recursive DNS, then how and which one?


2.
Should I self host Authoritative DNS? Or just keep using one that registrar provide by default in their dashboard. Or just use Cloudflare Authoritative DNS for speed?

If I should self host Authoritative DNS, then how and which one?

Self hosting is a solution. What is wrong with the defaults that you have today? What is your goal? What problem are you trying to solve?

  Comment: I use technitium dns server as both recursive and authoritative. I use the authoritative internally so my clients can hit internal IP's of servers instead of hairpining at the router. And recursive so I can use dns filtering for ad blocking. I only host a single dns server at the moment with plans for a paired one on a raspberry pi for redundancy. But every gets Google as a secondary dns server in case mind fails for whatever reason the wife can still use the internet.
