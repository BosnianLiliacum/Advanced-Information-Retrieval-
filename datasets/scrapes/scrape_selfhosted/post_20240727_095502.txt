So I have the whole Arr stack with Jellyfin, and with the exception of my wife watching a movie here and there I’m really the only user. Well my FIL was looking to watch a show on one of the only streaming services we don’t have.. the man is 82 and doesn’t have much to do besides TV. So I went to *legit places* and found the show. It’s now in Jellyfin and he will love it. Gives me an in to get him in there and see all the other totally legit media I have there too 🤣

  Comment: Wait until you set up [Jellyseerr](https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr) and get your users on it.

But congrats on the win. I know the feeling.
