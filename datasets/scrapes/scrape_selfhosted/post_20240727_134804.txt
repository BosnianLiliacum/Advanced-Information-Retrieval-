Post Content:
I’m curious if anyone has automized monthly/weekly/daily magazines (or newspapers) from download to organized in folders and make it available on some client with a reading app?

For tv shows, movies, ebooks and songs everything is more or less straight forward. But for magazines somehow it’s not that easy.

Currently I have configured sabnzbd to pull the magazines via a filtered rss feed. But where to go from here? What to use to move and organize the magazines and what to use to read them?

(I have tried Readarr and LazyLibrarian. They don’t support magazines)

  Comment: I do something similar with Calibre and Kindle. I have a Calibre recipe that downloads a bunch of rss feeds and create an ebook, then it sends the ebook to my Kindle account using email and I can read it from my Kindle or from my iPhone with the Kindle app. I don’t have it scheduled but I launch it using a shortcut from iOS sending an ssh command to my homeland. 
The subscribed rss feed is actually the starred feed of my TTRSS instance. So I daily scroll through my feeds, I star what I want to read later and when I’m ready I launch the shortcut.
