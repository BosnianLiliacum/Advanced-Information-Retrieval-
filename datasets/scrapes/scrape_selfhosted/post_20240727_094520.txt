Did I miss the announcement? I use this on a regular basis and at first glance it looks like nothing more then a name change. I'm just curious if anyone caught anything I may have missed.

  Comment: It’s now no longer owned and maintained by Logitech.  Fully handed over to community hence renamed, and also lots of good development going on.

Funny that on the Wikipedia page there is no "this project was renamed", just a bunch of replaced text strings from \[Logitech\] to \[Lyrion (formerly Logitech Media Server)\].
