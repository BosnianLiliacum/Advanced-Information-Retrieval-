Hey all, Im looking to work on my own music sever. I was wondering how you all solve the problems I am having though. 

im using nextcloud aio with the music app and power Apache on my phone to listen. This works great and I like it. but am willing to try other services this was just quick. 

the thing i would like to do though is automate songs being added to the library. Of course i wouldnt have everything but i would probably want it to at least download all the songs i have on a youtube playlist / albulm automated and Mabey download all songs from select artists.

btw im pretty willing to move to any server or client so just give what you think works well or you like.

  Comment: 3 self hosted app, Navidrome as music server, TubeSync to download your YT playlist and artists, MeTube for YT single music or YT Music. 

As client any Subsonic client will do.
