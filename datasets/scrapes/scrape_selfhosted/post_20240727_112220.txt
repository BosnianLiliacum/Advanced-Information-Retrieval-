Hello its me again talking about Endurain, a fitness activity tracker that you can self host. A new version is out and here are some highlights: 

* Added multi client support (web and mobile)
* Added multi arch Docker image (arm64 and amd64)
* Added PWA support
* Added OAuth Scopes

There is also an open issue on [runnerup repo](https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup/issues/1185) to enable activity auto upload in this Android app.  
For iOS me and u/hesselbom are in talks to integrate with his app.

Do you have any health/general fitness tracking on the roadmap? Things like HRV, sleep, training load, stuff in that realm. I’d love to have a self hosted Garmin Connect/Strava alternative but those are what I use most there rather than individual activities.

  Comment: Cool project! 

Are there minimal instructions on how to deploy the docker compose file? I copied the provided "[docker-compose.yml.example](https://github.com/joaovitoriasilva/endurain/blob/master/docker-compose.yml.example)" file, modified values accordingly, but I keep getting  "It was not possible to connect to the server. Please try again later (Undefined)" error when trying to login with the admin/admin user for the first time.

No values on the log (frontend or backend) but "192.168.1.137 - - \[26/Jul/2024:15:44:23 +0000\] "POST /MY\_APP\_BACKEND\_PROTOCOL://MY\_APP\_BACKEND\_HOST/token HTTP/1.1" 405 559 "http://192.168.1.20:9400/login" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_15\_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/126.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" "-"
