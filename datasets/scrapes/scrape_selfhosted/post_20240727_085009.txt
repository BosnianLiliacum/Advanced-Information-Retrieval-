On beginning of my self-hosted adventure, I set up ELK stack + Grafana in my Proxmox's LXC to monitor all other hosts - they send data via Beats to Logstash, and then I can use Kibana to search through logs from nginx, applications etc., and Grafana for nice visualisations.

I picked this stack because I was familiar with it from my previous job. Now, I think it was a mistake. 

ES continuously needs attention for no reason and more time it doesn't work than it does. Not to mention how much time I already burned for fights with ILM and OOMs...

So, I'm looking which elements to change in my monitoring stack, but to keep - pretty standard - abilities:

* **graphs and metrics** for CPU, RAM and some more things like IO etc.
* **alerting** when some parameters gets too high for long time
* **visualisations** like world map of requests on my main HAProxy
* **logs file parsing &amp; browsing** to check in nice way latest requests from nginx, or Laravel app logs

Currently, points 1 &amp; 2 are fulfilled by Grafana and I very like this tool. Map that I mentioned is implemented in Kibana, but I believe that Grafana can also do this, with some GeoIP magic. For browsing logs I use Kibana, because UI for filtering and query language are very convinient.

Can I change problematic Elasticsearch to, let's say, InfluxDB and use some other tool than Kibana to keep everything similar, but better? I'd like also to stay with Beats as I love how they work - but maybe I never heard about better tools! Love to hear your advices.

  Comment: I've done all kinds of things in this area.  Currently, I just use the glances plugin for home assistant.

Pulls all of the stats into home assistant where you can do alerting, triggering, and anything else you can do normally with home assistant.

  Comment: Zabbix, constant development, every metric (Item) can be turned into a Graph, great ansible collection.

check_mk is also fine, but i personally dislike fremium-models.
