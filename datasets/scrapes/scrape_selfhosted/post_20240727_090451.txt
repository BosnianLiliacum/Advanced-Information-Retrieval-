Hello, I currently have a email server hosted on a VPS. Id like to migrate everything to a home server and use that. The issue is setting up a PTR record, My ISP is xfinity. Is there a way to contact them to set it up?

  Comment: Chances are with a residential IP that you'd be blacklisted as a sender pretty quickly, especially if the IP is dynamic or has been used by a compromised machine before. Ultimately it's not worth it.

  Comment: If you really want to host the email server at home you could set up a tunnel between the VPS and your house, then you keep the reputation of the existing IP plus can host other things from home with that same IP.

  Comment: A residential ISP most likely won't allow port 25 traffic. They also won't allow you to set reverse dns. Even if they do allow it, you'll probably be automatically blacklisted because it's a residential ip.

Either tunnel to the vps like the other person said (I have very little experience with that), or set up the MTA on the vps, and make your local MTA forward through that.

  Comment: You want to host an email server at home, but don't know how to setup a PTR? Also, why would you need a PTR record?

No home ISP account is gonna let SMTP outbound, if you had a Comcast business account that'd be another story.
