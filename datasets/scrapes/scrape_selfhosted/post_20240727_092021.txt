Just noticed that [noted.lol](http://noted.lol) is down. Anyone know if this is just maintenance or something more serious?

  Comment: There were some breaking changes I was unaware of when updating from 5.8 to the newest version of Ghost and it causes the DB to crash. So... I am working on adding 9 posts back. Thanks to our partners at Kiwix for saving my bacon on this one. The site is back up and I'll be adding the last 9 posts back over the next couple days. You can see the archive here [https://library.kiwix.org/viewer#noted.lol\_en\_2024-07/noted.lol/](https://library.kiwix.org/viewer#noted.lol_en_2024-07/noted.lol/) but Noted is back online. Thank you for your concern.
