Hi all

I want to set up a Grafana stack at home for home logging.  Right now I'm running something on a Synology but I'm not really comfortable with this device doing several roles.  So what I want to do now is buy a little SBC to do all my logging.  I'm already running a special SBC for my home router.

I want the SBC to have no moving parts, so that means passive cooling (my router is passive cooled).  I don't know how much CPU is needed for this application but the part I'm not certain on is the data storage.  I saw there was an Orange Pi which apparently had 256 gig as a purchase option.  I think that would be enough storage, as I can set how long it is stored.

But I'd like to hear recommendations here to make sure I'm not missing anything important.

  Comment: I think you'll be fine. I'm collecting logs from three different sites in Loki. With a month of retention it's only using 475M of disk.
