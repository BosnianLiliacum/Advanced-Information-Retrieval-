Hey Self-Hosters!

I just wanted to quickly share my Self Hosted Setup for 2024, and at the same time, wanted to look for better self-hosted alternatives to my servers.

  
So, Here is my Setup:

1. Dashboard: Homer (Attached Image Down Below)
2. Files Hosting: OwnCloud
3. Photos Backup: Immich
4. Files Backup: Syncthing
5. Movies: Plex
6. Game Server (Minecraft): Puffer Panel
7. Password Manager: VaultWarden
8. Notes: Notion (Not Self Hosted)

  
Just to Clarify, Syncthing Created a Sync Between my Server, and my Laptop, which both combined have 2 x 2TB SSD's, and, all data works from the server, but, just as a backup solution, I keep a exact 1 to 1 sync of all my data from my server to my laptop using Syncthing, using Encrypted Transfer.

I also would like to switch to Heimdall from Homer, for my server dashboard, just because I am bored 😅

I also use OwnCloud, because I used to use NextCloud, but, that was too slow for my use case scenario.

Also, I have wanted to know, is there any self hosted alternative to Notion (Notes App)? Because I have not been able to find any good alternative like it.

Any Tips/Tricks/Alternatives would be appreciated!

  Comment: About ownCloud, im looking into Seafile instead of oc/nc, since i dont need all that other "bloat" oc/nc offers.

About note-stuff i currently do trello, but was only today wondering what self hosted that i could use instead, that is slimmer than trello (dont really need all the functions.. like only need the cards, checkboxes, and those "simpler" stuff)

Boomarks, i just recently installed Floccus and syncs my bookmarks to a private github repo.. wonder if its easy(?) to have those bookmarks shown in a homepage or similar self hosted page.

  Comment: The closest things I’ve found to Notion are [Docmost](https://docmost.com/), [SiYuan](https://b3log.org/siyuan/en/), and [AFFiNE](https://affine.pro/). 

But honestly, I think Notion still beats them by a long shot for me. So I’ve stuck to Notion. Curious what you think.
