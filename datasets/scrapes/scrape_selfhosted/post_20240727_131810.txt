Found a really cool project to track Spotify stats for my account and am hosting it on the Synology NAS w/ Docker. I've set it up successfully for myself, but want to allow it to function for other spotify accounts for the family.

I'm very new to docker, have setup like 6\~ containers functionally on my system, I'm just wary of altering this compose without any documentation.

Current Docker-compose YAML I'm running (Minus spotify apis, and local IPs):

    services:
      server:
        image: yooooomi/your_spotify_server
        restart: always
        ports:
          - 8080:8080 
      links:
        - mongo 
      depends_on:
        - mongo 
      environment: 
        API_ENDPOINT: http://(Local IP):8080 # This MUST be included as a valid URL in the spotify dashboard (see below) 
        CLIENT_ENDPOINT: http://(Local IP):3001 
        SPOTIFY_PUBLIC: (My Current DEV Public) # Spotify DEV Public 
        SPOTIFY_SECRET: (My Current DEV Secret) # Spotify DEV Secret 
      mongo: 
        container_name: mongo 
        image: mongo:4.4 #Synology NAS doesn't work w/ newer versions(?) 
        volumes:
           - /volume1/docker/your_spotify:/data/dbweb: image: yooooomi/your_spotify_client 
      
      web:
        image: yoomi/your_spotify_client
        restart: always 
        ports:
         - 3001:3000 
        environment: 
        API_ENDPOINT: http://(Local IP):8080

I'd appreciate any help, I found the project just looking thru linuxservers list of things and some people have mentioned it in the past on this sub, just not a lot of documentation to parse my way thru.

EDIT: The YAML apparently killed itself as I posted, so its closer to normal formatting now

  Comment: Go to the Spotify developer site and I think you should add your friends email address to your API key. Im not home so I can't tell you more

  Comment: As default users can register as far as I know. That can be turned off in the web ui when logged in as admin.
