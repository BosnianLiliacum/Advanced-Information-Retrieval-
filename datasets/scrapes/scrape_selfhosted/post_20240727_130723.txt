I am from India. I need help in building a home server. My old server just died because of some issues with motherboard and cpu. I have thought of choosing i5-12400f, since that is currently the cheapest one available here. I am open for suggestions on the CPU. I am not abe to decide on the motherboard. I would like some suggestions on the motherboard and RAM. I dont want visually esthetic build. As the cabinet i have chosen is something sort of a Black Box

Use case of home server which will be built on ProxMox

* NAS - Xpenology
* Virtualization - (Jellyfin, Home Assistant, NVR, Realtime - ML, etc)
* Encoding and stuff

Here is the list of what all I have:

1. GPU: Nvidia 3060
2. OS (Nvme): Crucial P3 Nvme 1 TB - with proxmox, xpenology already setup
3. Storage (SSD's): 6 \* 1 TB each (this is what i had started with)
4. Storage (HDD's): 2 \* 4 TB NAS HDD's (will be adding more)
5. PSU: Silverstone 850w
6. PCIE Cards: Dual Gigabit Ethernet card (PCIE x4)

As I have said, I have for now thought of intel i5-12400f, but I am open for suggestions

  Comment: servers run 24x7 so their power efficiency matters a lot at both idle and load. Amd cpus are excellent server cpus like 5600g and 8600g, the g models. So i recommend either a 5600g/b550 motherboard, or b650 motherboard/8600g.

You should be fine with even 4600g instead of 5600g.
