Finally done, happy with this setup :

* Router Omada TP-Link ER8411
* Switch Omada TP-L-Link SG2210XMP-M2
* 3 x AP Omada TP-Link EP615-Wall
* ISP Router (bridged, seems to be a big ONT right now) Freebox Delta (10 Gbits / 700 Mbits)
* NAS (not on the pic), tower Lian Li PC-A17B with Mini ITX Topton N5105, 32 GB, 5 x 8 TB HDD, 2 x 512 GB NVME and 1 x 2 TB for array cache

I'm very impressed by the Q/P of the Omada products, can feel significant difference, especially with mobile Wi-Fi devices !

Let me know what you will do more to achieve this setup.
