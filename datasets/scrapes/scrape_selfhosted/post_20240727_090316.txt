**I love Obsidian.**   
It has been my notes app for years and it is simply amazing. I do not use fancy plugins or loose too much time with bells and whistles, and all my notes are saved in a Nextcloud folder.

Although I am willing to change a few things:

* Browser support is becoming more relevant to me
* Being able to share notes and have other users is needed

**Outline** seems to be great alternative, but I would love to hear experiences from other people that perhaps followed the same path.

Alternatively, would you consider anything else besides Outline?

  Comment: This might be annoying, but I looked at everything that was required of Outline and was overwhelmed. I decided to try [Docmost](https://docmost.com/) and holy moly is it simple and awesome!

  Comment: I checked out outline a year ago, back then it did not have username/password authentication. As a beginner I did not know how to self SSO so I ended up not using Outline.

  Comment: Yes, I did. I was disappointed that there wasn't a more generic way of syncing between devices with Obsidian. I set up Outline and was really pleased with it. I also used Notion before, which has lots of features that Outline doesn't have, but I am still happy with Outline because it fits all my needs and Notion isn't self-hosted (also, you need a paid subscription to use all the features). I‘ve never looked back to Obsidian or Notion, but as I said, Outline doesn’t have all the cool features other tools have.

Just a quick note: I did all the migration manually because the export/import from Obsidian to Notion didn’t really work well back then (especially the links).

  Comment: Love hosted outline in my company, hate it selfhosted for myself.
The compose file is a bit annoying but you can get it running if you know what to do.
But the authentication stuff is just aggravating. 
That is if you don’t already run your own auth. If you do I think you will love it.

As someone pointed out Docmost is great. 
I use it at the moment, but I had problems with local storage and permissions. But setting up minio was actually quite doable.
Only downside for me is no sharable links. That’s the great boon of outline in my opinion.

Also both only run in the browser and not offline, which is why I still use obsidian for notes :/ surprisingly often I have bad internet where I live so I like the assurance that I can access all my stuff

  Comment: I use both but for different reasons.

Obsidian is used for quick notes i.e shipping lists, random thoughts ect

Outline is used for my documentation or any project that requires some where to document stuff. 

Since I only use obsidian on my phone and occasionally computer it doesn't matter that they don't have a web app. Wheres I might need to access my documentation from anywhere. 

I wouldn't say Outline is easy to use for quick notes or anything like that.
