I've got a couple trips coming up in the future, and I want to start keeping track of where I go/what I do on those trips, and tie photos to each place we go to based on location data. While that second part I know Ill have to do manually, Id love to find some kind of app that uses OpenStreetMap to let me pin locations Ive been on a map and write small notes on each place and rate them

  Comment: Many photo Organisation softwares have a map view (because today, most Photos have embedded Position data) and let you add custom tags aswell as rating. 

So you cpukd take a photo at each POI, and add the tag "Restaurants" and rate the Foto.
Lateron you can filter for All Fotos with the Tag "Restaurants" and Display them on a map.
