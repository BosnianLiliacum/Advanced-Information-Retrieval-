I switched browsers the other day and imported my bookmarks, thought about how valuable they are and was wondering if anyone had any kind of automated backup solution for theirs?

  Comment: I am not sure whether this is what you want but you can try raindrop for bookmark management. It is fully open source at github. I am using hosted version by the company, however you can host yourself [https://github.com/raindropio](https://github.com/raindropio)

  Comment: I stopped thinking in terms of "bookmarks" and instead started keeping URLs directly in my notes, where they have relevant context.  Personally I use Orgmode (because I think it is superior) but there is also Markdown, or other options.
