I hope this isn't considered self-promotion, but I wanted to share a series I'm writing on self-hosting. I'm looking to do guides for people completely new to the space and welcome feedback, especially on next articles to write.

The first is an overview of what self hosting is and the pros/cons. Then I wrote up a guide on how to setup Proxmox. The third installment sets up both a Linux and Windows VM.

I'm thinking the next one should be Docker with Dockage/Portainer/etc. I also want to write up how to use NAS storage on Proxmox but probably want something a bit more detailed or it'll be a short guide!

Anyway, would love anyone taking a look and providing feedback. It'll be pretty basic stuff for most here but everyone has to start somewhere so I'm hoping I can help some folks.
