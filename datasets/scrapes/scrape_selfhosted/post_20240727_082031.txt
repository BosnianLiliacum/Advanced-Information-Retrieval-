I have a pretty constant error with my services.yaml file via homepage. 4 out of 6 that I have tried to set up widgets for have an API Error. Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong? I just find it strange that 2 are working, which I think means it is unlikely to be a network issue?

Here is an example of what I have entered into the .yaml file:  
- Emby:

icon: emby.png

href: [http://myurl:8096/](http://myurl:8096/)

description: Media player   

widget:

type: emby

url: [http://myurl:8096/](http://myurl:8096/)

key: myapikey

- Lidarr:

icon: lidarr.png

href: myurl:8686

description: Music management

widget: 

type: lidarr

url: myurl:8686

key: myapikey

- Navidrome:

icon: navidrome.png

href: myurl:4533/

description: Music player

widget:

type: navidrome

url: myurl:4533/
