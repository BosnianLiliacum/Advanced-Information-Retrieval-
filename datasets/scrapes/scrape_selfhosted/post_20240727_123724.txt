I am trying to set up a home media server/pc, running Ubuntu and using jellyfin. I added a second 2tb hard drive to contain all the media files. I used the partition manager to format the new drive as ext4 and mount to /data, but the actual file path for the drive became /media/[pc name]/_data (I didn't add the "_" to the name it happened automatically). I built subdirectories of /_data/medialibrary/movies, tv, etc. all with permissions 775.

I installed jellyfin and went to [my IP]:8096 to set up jellyfin. I set up a username and password, then tried to add media libraries. I tried to add one with the file path /media/[pc name]/_data/medialibrary/movies, but I got an error message "the path could not be found. Please ensure the path is valid and try again."

However this is a valid path to a directory that exists, how do I get jellyfin to recognize it?

  Comment: Are the drives mounted?  Try editing your fstab at /etc/fstab.  

You're gonna add an entry like this:

```UUID=12345678 /_data/medialibrary/movies ext4 defaults 0 2``` then save and exit.  

then mount with `sudo mount -a` then check if the drive is mounted with `lsblk`.  Then go back to jellyfin and add the path in the library add window.

To find your uuid, run ```sudo blkid``` then look for your drive.

  Comment: Additional info: I have Kodi on the machine to play locally, it can connect to these folders but sees them as /data/medialibrary/movies etc. I tried this path in jellyfin but it still doesn't work.

  Comment: Are you sure you have the right paths? This might just be reddit messing with the slashes.

This is what partition manager mounted: `/media/[pc name]/data`

This is what you created: `/_data/medialibrary/movies`

This is what you configured for Jellyfin: `/media/[pc name]/_data/medialibrary/movies`
