As everyone had probably seen, immich has a new license (as far as their payment term license), and I read about it, but it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. 

Before I set it up, what are some good alternatives? 

Primary goal of viewing photos, and having it sync (and not jank like using syncthing)

  Comment: It doesn't have a new license. Same old AGPL v3. 

What you're referring to is a new structure for encouraging people to support Immich. It's still entirely free to use, people are just getting riled up via rampant speculation.

  Comment: No paywalled features with Immich, so don't dramatize ... if the project goes in a wrong direction, I'm sure there will be an licensed-free fork at some point ;) In the moment it's just one way to support the developers. 

Best alternative would be Nextcloud with Memories.

  
(and btw, I love Syncthing and I'm using it together with Immich, but that's personal preferences \^\^)
