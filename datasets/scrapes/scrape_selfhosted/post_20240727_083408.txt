My ISP no longer provides public IPv4 addresses due to IPv4 exhaustion. So I spent countless hours learning and setting up an IPv6 server, only to discover that my router, TP-Link C1200, [doesn't fully support IPv6 even though it claimed to be](https://community.tp-link.com/us/home/forum/topic/94783).

TP-Link C1200 has a built-in IPv6 firewall that blocks all ports by default, and you CANNOT DISABLE IT. This renders the public IPv6 address useless since you can’t open ports to the public internet. Thanks a lot, TP-Link.

  Comment: Pretty sure many old routers doesn’t support ipv6 on wan. Though work perfectly for wlan and lan.

  Comment: I look at it this way. It's a good excuse to replace a very old, EoL and unsupported, router.

  Comment: Do your ISPs provide IPv6?  Or are you tunnelling them from somewhere?

  Comment: I don’t have the exact same router, but maybe see if OpenWRT doesn’t fix? I have repurposed many routers that way

  Comment: Or change to a ISP that offers static IPv4 because maybe ISPs don't have IPv6 yet. Most ISPs offer them for a small one off fee, at least here in NZ.
