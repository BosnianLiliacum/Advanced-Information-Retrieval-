  Comment: Xxxxxxx.xyz domains are 1 buck, maybe shoot for one of those?

Other than that there are some domain registrars that offer free subdomains with some DNS control like you need for smth like that.

  Comment: you can always get .TK Free domain, but i'm not sure if it will work for DNS. 

Also not sure about long term TK ownership as well.
