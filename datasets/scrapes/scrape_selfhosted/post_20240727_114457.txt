Hello, I've been looking to host my own site for a while now, and finally I did it. I'm running an unmanaged VPS with Debian. The only outside ports I have open are HTTPS and SSH. I'm running NGINX as the reverse proxy, currently just serving some static stuff, overtime I hope to add an interactive app. Additionally I'm running Fail2Ban.

Now my question is should I do any other security hardening for the 443 port? Unlike the SSH port I can't just ban random IPs, but it also slightly feels very exposed.

  Comment: You can run crowdsec in order to ban IPs that exhibit certain behaviours. crowdsec also has lists and DBs of known offending IPs.  
Banning chinese IPs will likely also reduce the total amount of attacks on your system by half.

  Comment: There aren't really any security issues or hardening you can do to a port. You can allow/deny access to it.

Look into securing the service listening on the port. Use AppArmor/SELinux, enable a web application firewall, switch to a server that is implemented in a memory-safe language.

  Comment: Fail2ban or sshguard can also ban offending IPs reading the access log of the web server and drop/reject future connections to TCP 443.

  Comment: Make sure your firewall rules are protocol specific (TCP/UDP)  
Make sure SSH access is using certificates / keys for access and restrict access to only your IP if you can.
