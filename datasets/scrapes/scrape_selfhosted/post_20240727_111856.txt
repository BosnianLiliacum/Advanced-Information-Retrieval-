How do you get the tracker for Memory / Cpu Temps / Storage

Specifically in unraid? I see the system health monitoring under the widgets which I assumed would be what I need, but just keeps giving me 'Unable to find your system'. Which I'm sure has to do with it running in a docker container, just not sure how to fix or if I can.

  Comment: If i remember correctly it was done using [dashdot](https://getdashdot.com/) integration.

Edit:
Check [Homarr Hardware Integrations](https://homarr.dev/docs/integrations/hardware) out.
