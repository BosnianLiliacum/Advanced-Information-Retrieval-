Hi everyone,

As the title says, I'm looking for a lightweight system to glue my api's togheter.

I have a caddy and sftpgo instance, and I need to make requests to both for my setup.

Does anyone know of a way to glue them togheter so that I only need to make 1 request to a service that then makes the requests for me?

I also need it to be declarative, since I could do this with something like node-red, but I can't deploy that with ansible...

  
Thnx in advance.

  Comment: You could deploy a simple node.js service which takes the request, and then splits between caddy/sftpgo.

  Comment: I was about to recommend Node-RED and then I finished reading your post... Hmm good question, I'm looking forward to the answers.
