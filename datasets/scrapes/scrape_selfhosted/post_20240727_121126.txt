A few days ago the NVMe SSD of my mini pc started reporting failures and everything stopped working. I have backups and snapshots in place so I didn’t lose critical data. But what is weird to me is that the disk only lasted about 1 year.

I run about 20 docker services (*arr suite, photoprism, home assistant, etc), and a couple of cron jobs (poll TrueNAS for notifications, export files, etc). Is this too much stress for a single NVMe SSD drive? The drive was rated for 600 TBW, and I know this rating does not translate directly, but now I’m concerned if I just replace the drive and it lasts just one more year.

Could this have been a case of just a bad quality drive or is this “normal” for a 24/7 load of about 20 docker services?

The drive in question is a Silicon Power, not sure of the brand’s reliability but it had about 10k reviews and 4.5 stars.

  Comment: Did you check the SMART data?  It should tell you the TBW and/or remaining lifetime, which should tell you if you’re hitting the drive too hard or it was just a random failure.

As a point of reference, my server runs about 20 VMs (full VMs, not containers) 24/7, and writes on average about 100 GB/day.  At that rate it would take about 16 years to hit 600 TB.

  Comment: I would dig further in the reliability of the Silicon Power drives.

Normally in the consumer space drives like the Samsung Evos (firmware issues have now been fixed) are usually go-to's for decent write endurace.

Otherwise you into the second hand market for Enterprise grade drives but then you're dealing with U.2 adapters etc.

  Comment: 12 days ago my Samsung 980 Pro 1TB started reporting failures. Smart output showed:

* `Percentage Used:                    53%`
* `Data Units Read:                    4,118,330 [2.10 TB]`
* `Data Units Written:                 585,081,658 [299 TB]`
* `Media and Data Integrity Errors:    1,696`

It is rated for 600 TBW so I was surprised at the errors happening at \~300. I was also surprised I've written so much to begin with and after some digging discovered I had configured frigate to record to my SSD instead of NAS; moved those writes over and replaced the drive with a 500GB WD Red SN700. The SN700 has been in use for 11 days and is at 315 GB TBW but should be good till 1000 TBW; if I can trust the numbers this drive should last 100 years!

Thank goodness for having good backups!

  Comment: Silicon Power's RMA process is decent. I had an SSD failure and they replaced it for the cost of shipping ($10). Just had to provide a receipt to prove I was still in the warranty period.

Definitely not normal. Unfortunately these things happen. Not every drive is reliable and some slips through QA.

See if it's under warranty. Glad you had backups and snapshots. 


For next time you can use 
- [scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) to monitor the S.M.A.R.T data
-  [nfty](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy) for notifications. Note that scrutiny has nfty through [shoutrr](https://github.com/containrrr/shoutrrr/) integration 

Of course even with S.M.A.R.T monitoring and notifications. A drive can fail without any notice. 

Hope that helps.

  Comment: 1 year is definitely not ideal. Check and see if it's still under warranty; you may be able to get a replacement.  
Individual failures happen, that's what warranties are for. Unfortunately systemic failures also happen, and that's why I will no longer buy Samsung SSDs.

  Comment: Check SMART Wear\_Leveling\_Count to see if you used most of TBW or it's failed for aother reason.
