Hello,

I have an application running locally on docker.I access it localhost:port when I access it from my phone using my PC's ip I cannot access camera on that application because "Camera access is only permitted in secure context. Use HTTPS or localhost rather than HTTP".

How can I setup my local host as HTTPS.  
Thank you in advance.

  Comment: Add HTTPS, it’s litteraly what the error message says:

&gt; Camera access is only permitted in secure context. Use HTTPS or localhost rather than HTTP

Add a reverse proxy in front of your web applications. I recommend Traefik and then use Lets Encrypt DNS-01 challenge to get a free wildcard certificate. All you need is to own a domain. They come as low as 4$/year if you don’t care too much about style.

  Comment: I think you have a few options available : 

- Use a free service like ngrok : It will create a public URL with HTTPS under ngrok's domain, for as long as you decide to keep it open.

- Define a custom domain on your phone, that points to your computer. Then, have your computer serve the app over HTTPS using a self-signed cert for the custom domain you've set before. Note that you may have to manually add the self-signed certificate on your phone for it to work.

- Send the camera's stream to a remote service (a stream aggregator of yours, or something that's Dropbox-alike), then read that stream from your phone.
