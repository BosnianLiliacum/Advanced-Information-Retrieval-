Hi,

if someone is looking for a script to easily update and back up your self-hosted Invoice Ninja instance, this might be for you. It takes all the bells and whistles from you and helps you to focus on other things.

*Easily update and back up your self-hosted Invoice Ninja instance with a shell script.*

# Invoice Ninja Backup and Update Script

I’ve developed a comprehensive bash script to manage Invoice Ninja backups and updates directly from the command line. This script simplifies the process of updating and backing up your self-hosted Invoice Ninja instance. It automates all the intricate steps, allowing you to focus on more important tasks. The script is crafted from scratch, not just a one-liner. I’ve made an effort to document every aspect of the script to ensure that all questions are answered and to facilitate ease of use.

# Key Features

* **Automated Updates**: Downloads and installs the latest version.
* **Efficient Backups**: Manages backups with custom settings.
* **Installations**: Provisioned and clean options.
* **Maintenance Management**: Handles maintenance mode, cache clearing, and more.
* **Post-Update Tasks**: Includes data migration, optimization, and integrity checks.

Documentation is provided to guide you through the process and address any potential issues.

Have a great week! 🍒🍒🍒

Update: New Features Arrived!

# Installation Provisioning

During setup, the `.inmanage/.env.example` file is created, mirroring the standard `.env` file of Invoice Ninja. By pre-populating it with `APP_URL` and relevant `DB_` data, and renaming it to `.env.provision`, it becomes a trigger for automated [provisioning.Next](http://provisioning.Next) time you run the script, it performs the following tasks in one batch:

* Creates the database and database user
* Downloads and installs the tar file
* Publishes the `.env.provision` template to `.env` for production use
* Generates the application key
* Migrates the database
* Creates an admin user
* Reminds you to set up cron jobs
* Prompts you to create an initial backup

**Basically, you save a huge amount of time.**

# clean_install

* Downloads and installs the latest version of Invoice Ninja from Github.
* Target is the $INSTALLATION\_DIRECTORY which must be set during installation in `.env.inmanage`
* If the target folder already exists, it gets renamed and you start from scratch.
* Creates a clean .env file
* Generates the key into the .env file
* Generates the cronjob string for you (must be installed manually)
