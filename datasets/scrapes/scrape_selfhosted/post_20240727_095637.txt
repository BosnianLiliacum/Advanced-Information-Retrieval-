Hi Everyone,

I searched the group before posting but couldn't find the specific information I need about CRM systems.

I'm helping a team that has previously used Bitrix24 Enterprise, and they’re looking for a free, self hosted CRM that can replicate some of its key functions. They understand that a free option might have limitations but are looking for the following features in addition to standard CRM capabilities:

1. Task assignment (project/ticket management)
2. Integration with a messaging service, with the ability to assign messages by groups
3. Contact center functionality, potentially integrating with WhatsApp or SMS

Any recommendations or support would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

  Comment: You might want to check out Odoo CRM for a self-hosted solution. It has a robust task assignment system and integrates with various messaging services. For visual documentation and training, I highly recommend using Guidde  its been a game-changer for creating quick how-to videos for our team.
