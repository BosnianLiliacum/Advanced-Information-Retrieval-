I do a fair bit of ebaying and there's a plethora of apps out there to help you list in bulk and manage inventory etc.

Is there anything like this that's been developed open source and self hosted?

Inventory management seems kinda helpful but it isn't really targeted at buying and selling...that's more to do with simply cataloging everything you own.
