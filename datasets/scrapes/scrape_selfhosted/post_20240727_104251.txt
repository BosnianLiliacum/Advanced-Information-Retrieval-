we are trying to containerize our node.js application, but we are unable to.

The unzipped version of bundle is exceeding 250MB ( web pack bundling ) 

- Cause excess node module ( unused dependencies/ Devdependencies).

- Lot of warnings regarding node module versions .

This  was the earlier issue we faced so we tried containerize our application using Docker .

  Comment: That webpack bundle does seem pretty massive, but I would also consider putting the bundle on S3 instead of within a container image if it's not difficult to do with your deploy process.

This is a webpack bundle using the `--production` flag and minification/compression enabled (which I think is the default with the production flag)?

You might also consider turning off source maps.
