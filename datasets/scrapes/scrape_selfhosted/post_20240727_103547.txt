Post Content:
I currently use "Homepage" as my homepage/dashboard and overall I like it but I have a few gripes with it that they devs have not been willing to address so I'm looking for something else.

I mostly use it for monitoring resource usage on two ubuntu servers as well as activity on two emby servers and two plex servers (dont ask, I have a lot of users and these apps have dumb/arbitrary limitations as well requiring me to have 2 of each but thats for another thread)

I'm not sure if this exists, but I'd like something that is configurable and customizable using a gui/web interface as opposed to manually editing config files.

Other requirements are I need to be able to see how many active streams on each of my emby/plex servers as well as cpu, memory, disk and network utilization on each of my ubuntu servers.

If anyone has any suggestions on alternatives to look at that would be appreciated.

  Comment: [Homarr](https://github.com/ajnart/homarr). You can add widgets from Dashdot to monitor resources usage and also widgets from Jellyfin/Plex(also Emby I guess?). Everything is configurable via WebUI and optionally password protected.

  Comment: For monitoring, you might want to try out Grafana. It's highly customizable and has a great web interface for creating dashboards. On a different note, if you ever need an email service provider with advanced analytics and no subscription fees, I've been using beehiiv and it's been fantastic!

  Comment: If you ever decide to build something custom, you can try [self-hosted UI Bakery](https://uibakery.io/on-premise-ui-bakery). You could either set up some services on your servers that provide monitoring data via HTTP or connect to your servers using [SSH integration](https://uibakery.io/integrations/ssh) and get raw data. Afterward, you can pass this data to your UI Bakery components to present it in a needed way.
