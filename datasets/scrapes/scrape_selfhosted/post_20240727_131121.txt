Post Content:
My project currently has a user that can make API calls, and I want it so that if the license/subscription is not renewed or paid on time, it disables the service on the part of the user. Is there any service that is reliable that does this? I found Keygen and [https://netlicensing.io/](https://netlicensing.io/), does anyone have any better recommendations?

  Comment: There's lots of vendors on the market. There are some free / open source ones as well, depending on how much effort you are looking into configuring and maintaining it yourself. 

Other functionality you might want to consider may include: 

* handling offline scenarios, 
* if it needs to handle User-authentication, 
* if you're configuring trials or other sorts of feature flags, 
* if you're metering usage of functionality as part of the licensing mechanism), 
* app security (how easy / difficult would it be to circumvent). 
* Reliability / uptime is also pretty important for this sort of service, as well as how to handle situations when the server is not reachable.

I put together a list of 3rd party software licensing vendors (with no comment apart from their size) [here](https://licensespring.com/blog/other/licensespring-alternatives/):
