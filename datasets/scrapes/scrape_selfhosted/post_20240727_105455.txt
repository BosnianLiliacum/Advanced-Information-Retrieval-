I'm looking for a solution whereby people can photographically document the state of items in an inventory.

Basically they should be able to grab an item from my warehouse, scan a QR code on it taking them to the app, and then immediately take a photo (using the getUserMedia Javascript API) and upload it to the site. A nice gallery UI would be nice but is not a must - the main thing is to have the image files on my server.

Does anyone know of such an app? I've tried various apps but they don't seem to support the getUserMedia API.

Am willing to take an existing program and alter it - I'm an OK programmer.
