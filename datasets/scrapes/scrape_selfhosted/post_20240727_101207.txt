Hi guys, until now I've only used a single Rpi4 4Gb like home server (mainly pi hole and Nextcloud). Now I've recovered a mini-pc with an N95 and 8gb ram and so the idea is to add more services.

I am considering trying to use k3s, but from what I understand it is recommended to have at least 3 nodes. Do you think for home use it may make sense to try with only 2? Or do you have any alternatives to recommend for balancing the load between the two devices?

Note: the possible difficulty of k3s is not a problem, since I will need Kubernetes for a college course sooner or later

edit: I also have a Rpi0 W if it can turn useful in some way

  Comment: Could try a proxmox cluster but you won't have a lot of ram to dedicate to the VMs.  Could also look at docker swarm or just have two standalone docker setups hosting different stuff and integrated on the app side.
