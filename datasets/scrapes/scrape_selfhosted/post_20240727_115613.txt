Hello.

I am looking for a selhosted solution for backup of linux servers (mail and www).

Assumptions:

- compression

- incremental and full backups

- web interface

- possibility to backup more than one machine on one server





So far I have been using BackupPC and this solution worked great. However, I have been having problems with it for some time:

- it does not free up space after deleting old backups

- sometimes it only makes copies of directories skipping files

 

I would appreciate if you could recommend me reasonable solutions that meet the objectives.

  Comment: So I'd say restic: it touches all the points but no web interface AFAIK.

  Comment: UrBackup seems like it might be an option, little bit of a pain to setup, but works.

  Comment: +1 for restic. Fast and has deduplication. There's an out-of-memory issue being reported, so you might want to give it a test before committing. There is [Backrest](https://github.com/garethgeorge/backrest) for a Web UI. Seems nice, but haven't used it myself.

I'm using Borg backup on Linux. Runs well. Feature-filled and slightly complicated, but well documented. Opted for it over restic because of memory concerns. There's a sample script on the documentation site which performs a backup and~ prunes old backups. Restic has that feature as well.

Previous one I used was Duplicati, it has a web UI. Nice, but much slower than restic for the same files. Ran into issues when running backups for the same drive on a different Window sinstallation (7 -&gt; 10) .

Kopia is based on Go, looks promising, but haven't used it. Has a UI, make sure to get the correct variant. Like restic, there's a report of a memory issue. A while back they addressed it in a release.

Hope this helps.

  Comment: I recommend using Veeam as well. The Free Agent should fit well. The Community Edition can be also a good choice if you have a hypervisor. In case you need to push backups to the cloud, consider using StarWinds VTL, which works well with Veeam to enable cloud replication.
