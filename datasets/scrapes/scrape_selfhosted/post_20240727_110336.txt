I have a Synology NAS running a few docker containers. I was wondering if it is possible to have the containers on my Synology reference the other NAS in my environment? 

These devices are on the same network, and able to ping eachother, but I'm not sure how you could mount a network storage location on a NAS in this format, especially given the other one is quite old at this point. 

Thanks in advance!

  Comment: I don’t know synology well, but you generally can mount nfs in a container as a named volume. I do it all the time on my machines, with one central storage server. 

Does it give you a command line to start containers? Or a way to make custom named volumes? If so, use the local driver, and set options of type=nfs o=rw and device=&lt;host&gt;:/path/to/share

  Comment: I haven't done this before so I may be wrong, but I'm pretty certain you can easily point a container at another machine's dataset with an SMB share if the devices are on the same vlan or subnet. I don't have much experience with Synology NASs though, so I don't know how similar the setup is to Proxmox or TrueNAS.

Looking forward to other's responses on this. I don't have need for it right now, but you never know what could be handy later...
