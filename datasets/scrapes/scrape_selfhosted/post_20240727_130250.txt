Post Content:
A couple of months ago, maybe a year, I came across a bundle of programs that were being under development or still not fully released. 

It included a self hosted music, a video and another type of self hosted streaming app, but I completely forgot how the project was called. I found it browsing after Jellyfin alternatives and it was open source.



Does someone know the name of the program I'm talking about?

  Comment: If you recall what the GUI looks like, then use Google image search... I find this quicker than searching for the needle in a haystack.

  Comment: I forget the name, but I do remember the post. I didn't want to try since he mentioned it was all going to be subscription based. I noped out, but try searching for that.
