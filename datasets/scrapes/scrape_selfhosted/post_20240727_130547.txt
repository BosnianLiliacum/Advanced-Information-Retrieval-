Basically what I’m wanting to do is setup a web server on my home home server. I want to be able to keep and manage it all locally. 

But I want to point the domain at my VPS and have it act as a cache in front of the server at my house. This way a majority of the data will be served from the VPS and things will only come from the home server when needed.

  Comment: Why a VPS? Cloudflare would do this for free.

Look into [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/). It'll likely do what you're looking for. But you may need to adjust the Cache-Control headers on the content you serve from home.

  Comment: Why not simply rsync your home server website folder with your VPS in the cloud? Super simple to setup

  Comment: You also want to use Cloudflare or similar as your front end and restrict access to only allow connections from that.

Unless you have the ability to segment your home network with your website server being isolated, do not host things direct from your home connection to the world.

  Comment: Not exactly what you asked for, but a good alternative would be to deploy your website to your own server using Shiper [Shiper](https://shiper.app). Shiper allows you to connect your own server via Shiper Self-hosted Instances. This will also make your website available to the Internet. Then, add Cloudflare cache to cache your website in the cloud.

Shiper Self-hosted Instance Documentation: https://docs.shiper.app/self-hosted

Set up CF cache with Shiper: https://docs.shiper.app/projects/domains
Navigate to step 2 and select Cloudflare DNS

Small disclaimer: I am a member of the Shiper team.
