Post Content:
npm docker ssl certificate to another network

Hello,

I don't know if I have some configuration wrong (or even if possible), but I would like to put certificates to other devices that I have in another network in my lab.

  
The network where the NPM is 172.16.61.x/24 and the other network is 172.16.60.x/24.

from the docker server that is on 172.16.61.209, I can ping 172.16.60.209

I have created the same proxy host as another one I have that works on the .61 network.

Config that works:

Config that dosen't work:

My docker-compose.yml:

&gt;I would like to put certificates to other devices that I have in another network in my lab.

Can you clarify the situation a bit more. 

- you have two networks 
- what are the other devices? Are they services that you want network A to communicate to network B?
- can you draw a flow of what you want

Example:

Client -&gt; DNS (local or external) -&gt; reverse proxy A -&gt; network A -&gt; service on machine A

Client -&gt; DNS (local or external) -&gt; reverse proxy B -&gt; network B-&gt; service on machine B

Etc
