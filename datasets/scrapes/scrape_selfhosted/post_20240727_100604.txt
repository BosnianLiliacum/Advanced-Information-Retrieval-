  Comment: @shol-ly you should include more things in the listing, like number of GitHub stars or last release date. This usually helps to know if a project is dead or active

  Comment: Oh man, Immich! Their wording was super confusing. Thankfully, [they are working on it](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/discussions/11226).

"Please buy an immich license" is really just their way to say "please give us money". That's it. There's no software license change, no new paywall, no "open core" intent, and [they intend to keep it that way](https://immich.app/blog/2024/immich-licensing/).

Update: they just clarified, yay: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ea8iim/wording_change_and_clarification_for_purchasing/
