Hi everyone,

At home I run a homelab, and a raspberry pi running grafana+prometheus to monitor my home servers. On the servers I run exporters for prometheus, like cadvisor, mysql and node-exporter. Sercurity of those endpoints don't really matter to me since they are not exposed to the public.

I also have a public VPS at Hetzner, which I want to monitor on the same grafana dashboard, but don't want to expose the exporters insecurely.

I was thinking to perhaps set up a VPN connection to that VPS, so my raspberry pi can connect to it securely to access the exporters. 

Would like to know if you guys have a similar setup and have suggestions.

Thanks in advance

  Comment: A VPN sounds like a good way to implement this.

I have a few different sites I collect metrics from. I use mTLS client certificates with a reverse proxy at each site to allow Prometheus to scrape the /metrics endpoints. I do the same with Loki, allowing Promtail at each site to use a mTLS certificate to forward the logs to my home network.

  Comment: I use Slack's [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) for connecting all my hosts into a unified internal mesh network. Selected services can access each other using this network.
