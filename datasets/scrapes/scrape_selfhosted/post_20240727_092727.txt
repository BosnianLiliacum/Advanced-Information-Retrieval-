I know this topic is beating a dead horse, but I don’t know if something like this exists. I want a cloud storage program that I can just sign into, kind of like Plex, and just have files there that I can view/edit. Plex is so simple and doesn’t require any custom firewall settings set up. Does something like that exist?
