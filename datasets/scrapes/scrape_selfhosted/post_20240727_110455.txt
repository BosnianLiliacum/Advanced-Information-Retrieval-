So I use my own email server, does anyone know a simplified list of what to do to improve this? So it can be delivered into inbox instead of spam etc. I got my email server unblocked from microsoft so thats a flex, anyways back to the question, yeah I just need some advice on this. 

Thanks!

  Comment: Make sure your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are set up correctly to improve deliverability. Regularly clean your email list and avoid spammy subject lines or content. Also, consider a service like beehiiv that offers robust tools and analytics for better email reputation and deliverability.
