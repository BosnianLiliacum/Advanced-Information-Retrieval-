I have my own home server with an i5-13600K processor on an MSI Pro B760M-P motherboard, equipped with 2x16GB 3200MHz Corsair Vengeance LPX RAM. I'm using Arch Linux (because of the repositories) and Docker to run Jellyfin. Additionally, I have an SMB share using Samba, SSH, and sometimes a Minecraft server.

The problem is that after running for more than 24 hours, the server suddenly freezes completely. Jellyfin, SSH, and Minecraft (if running) become unresponsive. The system remains frozen until I turn the power supply off and on. Both the BIOS and every package in Arch are updated to the latest versions. I have only disabled secure boot and enabled XMP.

Has anyone else experienced similar issues? I hope you can provide a solution to fix this problem.

  Comment: First step would be to look in the system logs for an error messages.

Second step would be to find some diagnostics that you can use to test the hardware e.g memtest to check for ram errors.

  Comment: Apparently Intel 13th and 14th gen have stability issues in general. Don't think there is a fix aside from RMAing.
