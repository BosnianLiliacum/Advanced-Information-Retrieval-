  Comment: You're sure, you're out of CGNAT. Access ifconfig.me to check your public IP.

Port forwarding only works for IPv4. Can you try use IPv6?

You're firewall rules seems right. If you disable It, can you connect to It?

  Comment: Couple of questions just to clarify a couple of things.

- is the IP that you show on your router) firewall is the correct IP that is on the machine? Did you create a static IP for the machine on your router/ device that handles DHCP?
- are you able to connect to the machine locally( within your network) with the exact same port?
- can you confirm that you have a public static IP and it is working correctly?

Hope that helps

  Comment: Did you ensure you change your router configuration? If you got a static address you'd have to configure this unless they own the router, and would configure it for you.
