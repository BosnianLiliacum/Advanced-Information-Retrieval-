I don't really know a lot about technology so sorry if this question seems obvious. 

I like to write dark erotic fiction and am planning to self publish my stories next year on my own (eventual) website. I understand that a website needs to have a server host to operate. Unfortunately, it seems like all the servers I've researched have a policy against sexually explicit content. That's why I just decided to pay someone to make my own server. 

How much is the going rate for such a service? And where can I find people that can do this?

  Comment: You can do it for free with GitHub pages linked to a domain through cloudflare. Domain is $10. Or I can do that for 1,000,000,000 yen

  Comment: Are you wanting an e-commerce website to sell the stories you make or more of a blog where you post the stories?

  Comment: Free to do yourself. 

Lots of free wordpress options. It's easy to get started with.

Or, can hire a local consultant, which is going to run 50-200$ /hr.

Or, can use upwork to hire someone from India, for 20$

  Comment: Neither of these are self hosted so that may be a factor. 

GitHub pages is an easy way to host stuff for cheap but you’d need to be a bit technical to get the site to look right with html and css. You’d just need a domain name which runs about $10/yr. 

Another option would be to have a hosted Wordpress site and point your domain name at it. The domain name once again is about $10/yr and you can find pricing online about hosted Wordpress. I’d avoid hosting Wordpress on your home network or even hosting it yourself as it’s a highly targeted platform that needs regular security updates. Having a vendor do those updates for you is an easy way to go. I think this should be under $100/yr if not cheaper.

  Comment: SSD Nodes isn't the most amazing VPS provider, but it allows adult content. If you want a cheaper shared hosting option, TMD Hosting has decent options and also allows adult content.

If you just want like, a WordPress website, just get an account with either, purchase the service of your choice. They both give you the option of preset WordPress installs from the get go.

  Comment: If you don't want to host it on your own hardware &amp; network, there's nothing stopping you from going with Ghost CMS and their in-house hosting options for your type of content.

If you're looking for free options, you can always deploy it on Github Pages or Vercel...
