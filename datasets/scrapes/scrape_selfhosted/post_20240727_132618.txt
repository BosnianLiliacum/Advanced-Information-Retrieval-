I have recently started using Starlink as a backup ISP but self hosting doesn't work too well with a CGnat style provider.  To work around this issue I started an instance on AWS and am running Haproxy to redirect traffic down a Wireguard tunnel to a Nginx reverse proxy at the house.  SSL is being terminated at Haproxy.  Advantage is my home IP isn't known.  Major disadvantage is getting everything to work properly.  I have a few issues that I haven't figured out and to save time if I'm going down the wrong path I thought I'd ask if this is a worthy setup??

  Comment: Its a worthy setup. If you want something different, there are a whole bunch of alternatives - [https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling). I will advocate for [zrok.io](https://zrok.io) as I work on its parent project, OpenZiti. zrok is open source and has a free SaaS. It also has Caddy built in if that's useful - [https://blog.openziti.io/zrok-with-the-power-of-caddy](https://blog.openziti.io/zrok-with-the-power-of-caddy)
