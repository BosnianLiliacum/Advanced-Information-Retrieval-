Hello self-hosters!

I wanted to share a project I've been working on that might interest you. It's called PG Back Web, a self-hosted solution for managing PostgreSQL backups.

Key points:

* Easy to set up and use
* Web interface for backup management
* Supports PostgreSQL 13-16
* Scheduled backups
* S3 compatible storage

I'm looking for early adopters who might want to give it a spin. Your insights would be invaluable in shaping the project's future.

What features would you like to see in a self-hosted backup solution? I'm eager to hear your thoughts!
