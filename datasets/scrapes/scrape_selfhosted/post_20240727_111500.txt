If you had to buy a used server, where would one look and what would be a good price to performance ratio right now?

What do you want to do with the sever? Do you want rack mount or tower?

  Comment: I'd look on ebay with a set max budget and look for the most powerful rig I can find that wouldn't require me to buy upgrades right out of the gate.

  Comment: Depends what you want to do... last time I wanted to self-host something, I bought a refurbished mini-pc. 

It's not just about the horsepower for me, it's also about the energy demand.. that's what drove me to a little i5 based machine, and what later drove me to an N97 on a tiny board that sits on the corner of my desk.
