Hey there,

I am a contributor to this repository, Composio. It is an open-source platform that offers production-ready tools and integrations for building AI agents in python and JS.

And we just released the v0.1 of SWEKit, a simple and extensible framework for building Devin like agents.

So, here are the key features of [SWEKit v0.1](http://git.new/swekit)

* **Customizable**: Simple yet highly customizable, allowing you to use your preferred LLM providers, including open-source models and tailor prompts to your specific needs.
* **Framework Agnostic**: Compatible with all popular agentic frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, Autogen, CrewAI, and more.
* **Extensible**: You can extend the capabilities of SWE agents by integrating tools from the Composio ecosystem, such as Tavily, Jira, Notion, Linear, and even your applications.
* **Simple**: The framework is very simple, and you can start easily.
* **Agent Evaluation:** Evaluate the effectiveness of your agents by running them against the `SWE Bench`.

Here is an example of an SWE agent built with SWEKit that resolves GitHub issues automatically.  


A brief overview of the workflow

* **Issue Creation on GitHub**: The process begins when an issue is created on GitHub. This could be a bug report, a feature request, or any other matter that requires attention.
* **Webhook Trigger**: When the issue is created, a webhook is triggered. Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks activated by specific events. In this case, the event is the creation of a GitHub issue. The webhook sends issue-related data to SWEKit.
* **SWEKit Activation**: SWEKit is activated upon receiving the webhook notification.
* **Interaction with Agentic Framework**: SWEKit uses an agentic framework to coordinate interactions with LLMs.
* **Utilization of LLMs**: The agentic framework employs LLMs for reasoning, decision-making, and tool calling.
* **Ready-to-Use Toolset**: SWEKit utilizes a ready-to-use custom or Composio toolset to accomplish tasks.

You can add a GitHub integration via Composio or use your own GitHub access token. Checkout the complete example here: [GitHub Issue Resolver](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio/tree/master/python/swe/examples)

The framework is open-source; feel free to fork, use, fix, and enhance it as you see fit.

Needless to say, you can self-host SWEKit. It uses Docker by default for sandboxing code execution; you can use your own or Composio tools at your convenience.

  Comment: This seems amazing and I see that you also have support for local code indexing.
