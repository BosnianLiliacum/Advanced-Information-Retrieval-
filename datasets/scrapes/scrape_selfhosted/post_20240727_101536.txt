Hi everyone,

I have a Jellyfin server hosted on my network. I’d like to share access with friends and family. For the time being, I’ve port-forwarded a high external port to the server over http and used my firewall to whitelist my friends’/familiy’s IPs. I know this isn’t very secure. 

I recently bought a domain on Cloudflare and set up a reverse proxy via Caddy on my Jellfyin machine. This is good for encrypting my connection, but I’m forced to open port 443 and I can’t whitelist IPs since Let’s Encrypt needs access from various IPs. 

My last thought is purchasing an SSL certificate, converting it to PKCS12 format for Jellyfin, and installing it locally. I haven’t seen any guides about people doing this, however. 

Is there anyone who’s purchased an SSL cert and installed it on Jellyfin without a reverse proxy? 
Also, is there a way I’m missing to limit access to my server if hosted on 443 via reverse proxy?

Thank you for your time,

RoR

  Comment: Why not have the certificate on your reverse proxy?

This is how a lot of people do it within their homelabs

  Comment: I did three things for my external jellyfin:

1. LetsEncrypt SSL certificate via reverse proxy
2. Non-standard port to reduce noise.
3. Secondary docker container with read-only access to the media.

You can change to a DNS challenge so you don't need to worry about the HTTP challenge and let's encrypt with IP whitelisting of there servers. Of course you can keep whitelist your friends IPs

Here is how you do a [caddy DNS challenge](https://github.com/DoTheEvo/selfhosted-apps-docker/blob/master/caddy_v2/readme.md#caddy-dns-challenge)

This walkthrough will use cloudflare but for anyone else reading you can use any of the caddy [DNS module](https://github.com/caddy-dns)

You may also want to look into CrowdSec. Here is a sample for [caddy](https://github.com/hslatman/caddy-crowdsec-bouncer)

Note I haven't done CrowdSec with caddy. I put it on my firewall 

Edit: for an already made caddy docker image for cloudflare and CrowdSec by [serfriz](https://github.com/serfriz/caddy-custom-builds). Understand if you want to build the caddy image on your own or if you plan on using more caddy modules where you need to build on your own. 

Let me know if you have any questions 

Hope that helps.
