Making this post to spread the good word about [n8n](https://n8n.io).

Today, I decided that I wanted certain files on my server backed up in Dropbox every hour. Normally, I would just write a script and set up a cronjob to call it. If I went down that route then I would have to:

1. Write the code to call some APIs that are hosted on my machine
2. Spend some hours figuring out how to authenticate and interact with the Dropbox API
3. Spend another few hours debugging the script and making sure everything was working as intended

I thought "Hey, let's try to use n8n to do this" and so I did.

It took 20 minutes. 20 minutes to have a workflow which runs every hour that calls Miniflux to get my RSS feed data, Mealie to get my recipes, and then upload those files to Dropbox. I got all of the functionality that I wanted + the logging and monitoring that comes out of the box with n8n.

Now, when there are new things I want to add to the workflow, I won't be thinking "Ugh, time to change that hacky script I wrote 2 years ago". I just go into n8n, add whatever else I needed, and then go about my day.

I just wanted to share my excitement with you all. Are you guys using n8n or any other workflow automation tools to do anything cool?

  Comment: I never tried n8n because actually seems a fantastic piece of software, but isn't truly open source.

I would hate to be engaged into it and then having to accept what happened with IFTTT

  Comment: +1 for n8n.


For the longest time, I was looking for a way to automatically wake myself up if I were to receive an email from my boss early in the morning, but let me sleep in otherwise. I'm a night owl and prefer to wake up later if nothing needs my immediate attention. No one on the internet seemed to have a solution for this. 


By chance, I stumbled across n8n while browsing docker apps. I wasn't even thinking of that particular use case when I installed it, until I saw that it could call on the Gmail API. That really got my gears turning. I have it setup now to automatically SSH from my homelab to my main desktop and play an alarm sound over the speakers if I get an email from my boss between 8 am - 5 pm. 


Now I get to sleep through the mornings with full peace of mind.

  Comment: I recently discovered windmill.dev and it's exactly what I needed to do small things and glue stuff together without having to make it a full sized project

  Comment: n8n looks very cool but I had three problems with it:

* It's not really OSS.
* Straight after installing it automatically wants to connect to n8n servers in the internet. Just gave me a bad feeling. I want everything to be as local as possible. And I cannot comprehend when and where and with what data n8n is talking home.
* Every execution of a workflow is stored in the database. The log will grow and I have to take care of rotation.

  Comment: Anybody have experience with this vs Node Red? That’s what I’ve used for this kind of task in the past but I see n8n coming up a lot more

  Comment: N8n is great but not sustainable on a server since every single execution is stored in the database without any retention policy. That was quite a turnover for me, so eventually I went to JupytherLab (yeah, I know that it is not very much visual)
