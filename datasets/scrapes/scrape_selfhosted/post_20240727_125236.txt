So i have a hpe server running proxmox that has 4 nic’s and a ilo port, i want to run the following: truenas, docker, ubuntu cli. Is it worth it to buy a switch and hook up 4 nic’s and the ilo port or should the 1 nic be sufficient for al vm’s?

  Comment: You could set link aggregation up. You'd quadruple your bandwidth, sort of (eg 4x1GB gives you a 4gbps bandwidth, but on 4 pipes of 1gbps max). My NAS is set up like this - has 2x1gbps NICs on the motherboard.

It's not complicated but it is a complication, so if you don't need it there's no point.

  Comment: I like spreading multiple VMs over multiple NICs, or dedicate NICs to certain VMs.

  Comment: I use one NIC for VMs in my internal LAN and one for DMZ..my router also has several NICs so the networks are physically seperated

  Comment: I highly doubt you will even saturate a single interface. Don't worry about it.
