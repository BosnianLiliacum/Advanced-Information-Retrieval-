 I've just installed Authentik as a Docker container two days ago and each day, I've found myself still logged into my Authentik account despite turning off my computer at the end of each day.

I'd like to be automatically logged out of my Authentik account after a few hours, for example. Is this possible?

I assume I need to change a session length or some such?

I did a search of the documentation but couldn't see anything obvious. I found [this](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/flow/stages/user_login/#:~:text=Session%20duration%E2%80%8B&amp;text=You%20can%20set%20the%20session,Microseconds), but the article doesn't actually explain where to make that change. I went through the admin interface and couldn't see anything obvious either...

Thanks in advance.
