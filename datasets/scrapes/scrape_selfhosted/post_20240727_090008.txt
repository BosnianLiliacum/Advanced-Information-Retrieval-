I was looking for a solution to share secrets that supports encryption and automatic expiration. I came across this cool project that was started about 10 years ago and is still actively being maintained today. I have absolutely no affiliation with the author or project, but figured I would share it here in case anyone else needs a similar type of solution. You can self-host it or you can just use the hosted instance.

  Comment: I follow the instruction to build the yopass but I can't get the generated link to work.

This is the server:
```
$ ./yopass-server --address 192.168.48.90
```

This is the client
```
$ echo "This is a secret demo." | ./yopass --api http://192.168.48.90:1337 --url http://192.168.48.90:1337

http://192.168.48.90:1337/#/s/32955368-2399-4048-a71a-93c61accee05/-UBQzYHRtvKbw09n-kmVDe
```
But this `http://192.168.48.90:1337/#/s/32955368-2399-4048-a71a-93c61accee05/-UBQzYHRtvKbw09n-kmVDe` give me 404 page not found.

  Comment: PrivateBin or Send (new fork of Mozilla Send) are also great. There is also Bitwarden Send (selfhost via bitwarden-unified or better vaultwarden).
