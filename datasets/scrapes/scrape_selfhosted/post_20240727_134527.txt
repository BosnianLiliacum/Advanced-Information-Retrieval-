Post Content:
The open source engine indexes your memes by their visual content and text, making them easily searchable. Drag and drop recovered memes into any messager.

See the app and walkthrough here 👉 [https://github.com/neonwatty/meme\_search](https://github.com/neonwatty/meme_search)

The backend is built using these great open source components:

* moondream: a tiny, kickass vision language model
* all-MiniLM-L6-v2: a popular text embedding model
* faiss: a fast and efficient vector db
* sqlite: the swiss army knife of dbs

EDIT: lovely responses here!   please let me know about your experiences with the app and any new features you'd like in the future - either here or on github.

tracking feature requests in the repo issues -https://github.com/neonwatty/meme\_search/issues

EDIT 2:  now Docker run-able!  once pulled you can now start the app via docker-compose via

`docker compose up`

at the terminal or by using any container manager (e.g., Dockge, Portainer, etc.,)

EDIT 3:  just merged our first pull request from a contributer!

EDIT 4:  A new "refresh index" button to update the index when images are added or removed from the data/input image directory, affecting only the newly added or removed images.  See \[the gif in the updated README.md\](https://github.com/neonwatty/meme\_search?tab=readme-ov-file#index-your-own-memes).

  Comment: While this is brilliant for memes, I could see this being extremely useful for searching large collections of DnD assets (maps, tokens, monsters, etc)

  Comment: Great start! I hope GIFs and videos are on your roadmap, I could really use something to organize the dumb stuff I download from discord. I get that it's a huge step from images, but I figured it's worth throwing out here.
