It looks like Ente open-sourcing/docker images have been a thing for a while. Yet I've not found any tutoials to selfhost it. I searched on the web and found very little:

* [Official docs](https://help.ente.io/self-hosting/)
* [Some reddit posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/enteio/comments/1b723qt/how_to_tutorial_how_to_self_host/)
* Basically no youtube videos

I just `docker compose up -d` and all seem to up and running yet `curl localhost:8080/ping`, which the official docs tell me to do returns: `curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server`

ChatGPT hasn't been very helpful atm. 

Any ideas? Why is there little to no resources...

  Comment: Do 
docker compose logs -f
For logs. Maybe it cant bind to the port or maybe its not in host Mode etc.

  Comment: ss -tulpen | grep 8080

T tcp
U udp
L listen
P process
E extended Infos
N no name resolution

Run it as root or with sudo 

No output, no process listen on port 8080
Output? Check which process use this port, should be docker.

Alternatively run

Docker compose ls

Inside the folder where ur compose file is
You will see on which port your container is listening
