Post Content:
I have added a large amount of requested features to the self-hosted webscraper "Scraperr". In this new update, I have added:

* Multi-page scraping (within same domain of original link)
* Custom JSON headers (will override headers of request with entered headers in JSON format)
* Queuing system, with separation of scraper and API, for interacting with previous jobs and logs while scraping jobs run
* UI updates
* View container logs inside of the Web UI via the "View Logs" page

The multi page scraping system will take longer, simply because there are more links to scrape, and there will most likely be lots of bugs in this, please fill out an issue if you encounter one.

  Comment: First time seeing this project. Looking lovely!

But didn't get the sense of potential use-cases, could someone share their experience with this?  
I just want to understand if I need this for myself or not. 😅

  Comment: How does the actual scraping work in this? Does it emulate a browser and if so, can it perform browser steps?

Also how does Scraperr fair in JavaScript websites (built in React for example)?
