\[UPDATE\]  
Substreamer is now working. I have reinstalled it (twice, after the App Store didn't let me at first) and then set it up again (server, credentials) and waited for it to build the local library. Now it shows all albums etc.

Thanks for your support, though!  


Hello fellow selfhosters,

I got my hands on an old iPod/iPhone dock with 30-pin connector and reactivated a spare iPhone 4 that I had lying around, planning to use it as a client for my music server (Lightweight Music Server, which exposes a Subsonic API). But, unfortunately it won't load the webinterface of the LMS and the last iOS 7 compatible version of Substreamer (what I am using on my other devices without any issues) won't work as it should (login is possible, it loads all the albums etc, but doesn't display anything).

Does anyone have a recommendation for another app, alternatively a Subsonic web frontend that runs on the old iOS 7 Safari?

thanks!
