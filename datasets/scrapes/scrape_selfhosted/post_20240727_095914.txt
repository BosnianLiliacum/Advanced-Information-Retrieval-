Hey everyone,

A friend managed to get hold of a rack server and a netapp appliance for me to use for our agency. I’m stoked to use it, especially for archiving footage from the production team. I was curious about using projectsend for client portal access to files though.

Currently, we host all client files on Google shared drives, as well as use that for internal files. Ideally, I would like to move that storage to our server, and then use ProjectSend to deliver files to clients for approval.

I was also wondering how difficult it would be to add an approval workflow similar to transfer portals, where clients can mark a file as approved or denied with some feedback.

The approval workflow isn’t super necessary, but would be a fantastic tool. Really, just looking for advice on how to get started, and if ProjectSend would be a good way to handle what I’m talking about. I appreciate everyone’s feedback!

  Comment: ProjectSend is a solid choice for client file delivery and approvals. It's feature-rich and customizable, so you should be able to set up workflows with some tweaking. For tutorials and setup guides, you might find using a tool like Guidde super helpfulit lets you create how-to videos for your team in seconds. Best of luck with your new server!
