Hi all, I have been hurting my brain trying to figure out how to get the navidrome homepage widget to work. I thought that I had found the answer, I've found the subsonic-salt key via inspect in Firefox, entered my password followed by salt into md5 hash generator, and still that code does not work. 
Please help!

  Comment: You can utilize the following procedure to generate a token:

1. Salt (Random string of at least six characters) = `c19b2d`
2. Password (Navidrome Password) = `sesame`
3. Concatenate Password and Salt = `sesamec19b2d`
4. Token (Generate the MD5 hash of 'Concatenated Password and Salt' at [md5hashgenerator.com](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/)) = `26719a1196d2a940705a59634eb18eab`
5. Widget config:

`widget:`

`type: navidrome`

`url:` [https://navidrome.mydomain.com](https://navidrome.mydomain.com)

`user: admin`

`token:`26719a1196d2a940705a59634eb18eab

`salt: c19b2d`
