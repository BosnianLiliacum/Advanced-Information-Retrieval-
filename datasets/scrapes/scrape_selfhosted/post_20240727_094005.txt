Post Content:
My spouse and I would like to start taking and sharing some very private photos between ourselves, of us, if you know what I mean. We already utilize Synology photos for our regular family stuff, but I’d like to use a different app for these in order to maintain separation, so they aren’t accidentally exposed when showing someone family photos. Obviously these will be in a separate encrypted share on the Synology NAS. What’s a good self hosted service/app to view them? Photo Prism, something else?
