Hey guys, im lost. I’m having trouble with my Docker setup where the deluge container cannot connect to the gluetun VPN container. I’m using Docker Compose to manage both containers, but despite being on the same network, deluge fails to communicate with gluetun and shows a “Unable to connect to daemon” error in the logs.
