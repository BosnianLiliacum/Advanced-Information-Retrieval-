**For example, entering:**

&gt;`docker run -d --name quakejs -e HTTP_PORT=&lt;HTTP_PORT&gt; -p &lt;HTTP_PORT&gt;:80 -p 27960:27960 treyyoder/quakejs:latest`

**Will convert to:**

&gt;`version: '3.7'`

&gt;`services:`

&gt;`quakejs:`

&gt;`image: treyyoder/quakejs:latest`

&gt;`container_name: quakejs`

&gt;`environment:`

&gt;`- HTTP_PORT=&lt;HTTP_PORT&gt;`

&gt;`ports:`

&gt;`- "&lt;HTTP_PORT&gt;:80"`

&gt;`- "27960:27960"`

&gt;`restart: always`

You also have additional options such as mapping ports, volumes and custom environment variables.

  Comment: This is cool, thanks! I like the extra options beyond just converting the run cmd to compose.

  Comment: `version` is deprecated in docker compose files, worth taking it out of the conversion.

  Comment: Can it go the other way? 

Sometimes I find myself needing to convert compose and env files into a normal run -d command, so it'd be handy to have a script that could do it.
