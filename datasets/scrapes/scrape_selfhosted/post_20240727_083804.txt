Hey, currently thinking about making things more automated and reproducible.
Seems like a configuration management system like Puppet, Pulumi, Salt, Terraform (OpenTofu) etc. Would be very useful.
Has anyone compared these? Especially the open-source only versions.
I quite like Puppet by the looks of it, any experiences?

  Comment: I haven't used OpenTofu myself, but I have heard it's pretty much a drop-in replacement for Terraform. Over time, these two projects will drift apart though, so be prepared for that. 

I would recommend using a combination of OpenTofu for resource provisioning, and Ansible for configuring systems via SSH (install / update packages, etc.).

I would stay away from Puppet. Salt might be a good alternative to Ansible, although I've never used it. Pulumi probably makes sense for major cloud vendors and Kubernetes, but not much else.
