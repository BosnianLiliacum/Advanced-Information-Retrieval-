  Comment: No option for a PC/ old machine you have lying around the house?

The issue with most of the devices listed; they all come with ads. Yes easy plug and play but the amount of ads is ridiculous. (I guess you can install a custom home screen/launcher)

With a PC/ old machine you have lying around, this isn't a problem.
