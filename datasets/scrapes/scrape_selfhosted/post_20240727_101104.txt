Post Content:
I've been toying with exporting all my photos out of Google Photos and self hosting as I have several proxmox systems which would work well and I'm getting further and further away from cloud solutions.

Has anyone got experience exporting from Photos and is there an easier way than their options?

Thanks in advance!

  Comment: Looking at **Settings**, I see

Export your data

Make a copy of your photos &amp; videos, which you can use with a service outside of Google, or keep as an additional backup

Backup an archive of your data

Prepare a backup of your photos &amp; videos for download, or to send to another service outside of Google. [Learn more](https://support.google.com/accounts?p=download_photos_data)

  Comment: I have been doing a deep dive on most of the options out there. And every one has that one tiny little deal breaker that ruins the experience. I thought I had it with Immich and then realized they don’t offer a vault, or private albums. And in the GitHub page they stated it’s not even on the rarer. I mean seriously, it’s 2024, and everything has a vault.

  Comment: Just FYI, Immich announced paid tiers today. It reeks of enshittification.

Edit: downvote all you want. This shit happens **all the time**. Pay attention to the wording and think critically for two seconds. I really hope the dev just made a dumbshit choice with the wording, but I'm not holding my breath.
