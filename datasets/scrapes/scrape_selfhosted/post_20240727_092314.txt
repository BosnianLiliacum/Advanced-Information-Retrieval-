Hi! I wanted to share something I've been working on for the past few months: a drop-in replacement for AWS SQS. If you already have code that uses SQS for message queuing and background jobs, you can run this and just change the connection string.

It deploys as a single go binary and uses SQLite as the underlying store. On my local machine it can handle thousands of requests per second and I'm doing a lot of work to improve this.

Would love any and all feedback!
