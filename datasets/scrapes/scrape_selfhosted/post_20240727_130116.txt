I would like to use some AI model (locally / self-hosted on small PC without GPU) where I provide input as short video (max. 30 sec) and as response I receive text - description what is happening in the video?

Just to enrich notifications from IP cameras.

Thanks

  Comment: If you need a super-easy way to generate descriptions and visual documentation for short videos, you might want to check out Guidde. Its not a local AI solution, but its great for creating and editing how-to videos and embedding them in various platforms.

  Comment: Give me the weekend to whip something up. I will warn you that it won't be happening GPU free. It's just difficult currently.
