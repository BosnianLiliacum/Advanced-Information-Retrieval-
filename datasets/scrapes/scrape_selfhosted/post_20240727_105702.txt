  Comment: NAS is not just for storage. It does everything! You can run 100 containers, each costing 10$/month were you get them by subscription: office, password manager, sync, etc

  Comment: GL storing and accessing for example a library of 20 TB of movies/shows at 10 GB/s on the cloud. I wonder how much that costs?

  Comment: Network Attached Storage (NAS) is usually faster than cloud storage, but the cloud isn't the best option for people without unlimited data from their ISP or a slow upload speed like mine, which is capped at 25 Mbps. It would take a really long time to back up all of my storage. The downside to NAS is how much you can afford the storage, which could easily cost you as much as $1,000 for a decent setup, and that’s where cloud storage shines because you are only charged for the amount stored.
