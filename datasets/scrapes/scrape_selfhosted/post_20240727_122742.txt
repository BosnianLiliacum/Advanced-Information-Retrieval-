So i have a mini pc and i want to upgrade it with an ssd its the GB-BRi5H-8250 (rev. 1.0)(https://www.gigabyte.com/Mini-PcBarebone/GB-BRi5H-8250-rev-10#ov)

On the site it says it can be upgrade with either a ssd or a hdd. 
This mini pc does not have the standard sata port and will need something i think is a sata ribbon cable.
My question is where can i Get it. I live in Europe and i find stuff like ASUS P1412CEA/X415EA HDD FFC 0,5 mm L101-kabel but it is a spare part for laptops notebook series so what cable and where should I get it?

  Comment: That model should have an M.2 slot, I believe? That would probably be your best bet for upgrading the SSD. There is never a guarantee that OEMs use a "standard" pinout for those types of connectors, so while it likely could be compatible with something that looks similar, it's also entirely possible that the wiring is different.

The M.2 interface should be compatible with a much faster PCIe SSD, just make sure that the notches are correct and do not install a SATA interface M.2 drive.
