Hey guys, version 2.4.0 of [Tasks.md](https://github.com/BaldissaraMatheus/Tasks.md) was just released. The biggest change is the improved drag-and-drop experience, which feels much better to use. For touch devices it was fully overhauled, since it was not really working before (which is embarrassing tbh). You can see below a comparison between the previous version and the current release.

New release:

[Tasks.md](https://github.com/BaldissaraMatheus/Tasks.md) is a self-hosted, Markdown file based task management board. It's like a kanban board that uses your filesystem as a database, so you can manipulate all cards within the app or change them directly through a text editor, changing them in one place will reflect on the other one.

You can see below the main changes included in the new release.

* Feature: Greatly improves drag and drop experience: New swap animations, visual indications and better interactions for touch and mobile devices;
* Feature: Adds autoscroll when you drag cards and lanes partially out their container;
* Bugfix: Fix touch and navigation on touch devices;
* Bugfix: Fix issue where navigation bar outgrows lanes;
* Bugfix: Prevents saving card name with invalid characters;
* Bugfix: Fix some smaller issues;
* Documentation: Remind user to hard-reload the browser after changing a theme.

At work, we are forced to learn Ruby on Rails right now, and this was a project for our R&amp;D division.

  Comment: Is there a way to install this on a shared-hosting server, without relying on Docker (which is not available, at all)?
