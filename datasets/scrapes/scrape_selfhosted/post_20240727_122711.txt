Hello, for privacy reasons I am quite reluctant to using such instant messaging apps as Whatsapp. So I have set up my own XMPP/Jabber server to communicate with my family. Now I am considering opening myself (a little) to the outside world with the help of XMPP transport Slidge.

Has anyone of you any experience with it, setting it up, using it ? I have given a look at the documentation but it is quite minimal and I hardly understand how to have it to work. I would set it up with Docker, on the same Docker network as my Jabber install. I am interested in Telegram and Whatsapp transports.

Any one of you might be of help ?
