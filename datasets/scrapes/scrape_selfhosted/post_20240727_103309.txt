Hi to all,

I'd like to share on my local network a pair of usb drives to make them available on the local network.

I have the router given to me by my provider that permits only sharing of fat and ntfs drives using samba protocol.

I need to share an ext4 drive and have hard links, so I would like to share with nfs (I'm using linux pcs).

I do not need and I do not want to make the shared hdd available outside my LAN.

At the moment I have an old asus n752VX laptop (https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-N752VX-GC131T-Notebook-Review.161407.0.html) that I use as HTPC and which is always in suspended to ram state except when I use it in order to save energy  (I think it's idle consumption is quite high).

So I think it is better not to use it as nfs server.

I have also a not used lenovo miix720 (https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Miix-720-7500U-QHD-Convertible-Laptop-Review.207928.0.html). 

It has not functional touchscreen and cpu fan cooler, but I've already set it up to never go above 1400Mhz in order to avoid the CPU overheat. 

I'm wondering if I could reuse the lenovo miix 720 or if i should buy some specific hardware (a raspberry, a nuc, etc). I think that the lenovo is already quite low consumption so maybe it is better to reuse it instead of spending money for another hardware.

What you suggest me to do?

Reuse the lenovo miix 720. Any machine can provide NAS functionality. You can even install it with headless Linux so you don't need the screen. 

Since you have the hardware you might as well use it and test it to see if it fits your needs. 

Typically it's not worth the upfront cost of a new machine VS the power consumption of the hardware you have.

But of course you can do the price comparison of electricity cost of the current hardware you have VS the upfront cost of a new machine. See how long it will take to pay off the new machine with the electricity cost compared to just the old machine electricity cost. If it's 1-2 years then it worth it. If it's 5 years, typically not worth it. 

Hope that helps

  Comment: According to your link, the Miix 720 has a 15-watt SOC. As a rough estimate, keeping it always on would cost $15/year on average in the United States (higher in most other places).

If you are sure your only use case is an NFS server, you might consider selling the Miix 720 for parts and using something more power-efficient like a Raspberry Pi Zero ([&lt; 1 watt](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/revisions/5034/11)).
