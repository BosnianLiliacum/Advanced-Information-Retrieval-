Doesn't necessarily have to be self hosted but that would be great. I'd like a service where I could watch videos with my friends, similar to Discord's YouTube watch party feature (a host that can play/pause the video, and the video is synced for everyone watching), but with any video file instead of youtube videos.

  Comment: I remember Jellyfin also having a watch party feature, although I've personally never used it.

  Comment: Plex has a Watch Together feature. It works pretty well, as long as the server has fairly decent upload rate.

Has some issues; like age restricted videos being non-embedded from youtube...

Owncast is an option but it doesn't sync it quite as well.

  Comment: Jellyfins sync is hit or miss for me, honestly I would recommend streaming your screen to a discord server (or self hosted alternative)
