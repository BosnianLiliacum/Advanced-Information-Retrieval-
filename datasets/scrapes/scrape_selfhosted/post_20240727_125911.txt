I've been searching and maybe I'm just not looking in the right place or phrasing things correctly, but I want to be able to stream a video across multiple systems in my network simultaneously. Does anyone know if this is possible? Let's say I wanted to play a movie or recorded show on TVs in 3 different rooms when friends are over, any thoughts?

  Comment: Jellyfin has a built in feature for this, called SyncPlay. Any user can make a 'group', and then other users can join their stream, and it will be synced with all other group members. Pausing one pauses all of them.
