I've been halfway around the world from my servers. They ran fine for 11 days. Went offline last night. I don't get back for another 9 days. I feel so lost and disconnected. Help me.

  Comment: Happened to me a few times. Since then, I've been using smart plugs on my servers which I can turn on and off remotely. 99% of the times, turning it off and on again solves my problems :D

  Comment: I've been there.... been half a planet away when the stakeholder (the wife) calls "hey, internet no worky!"  Oh no.  Worst case scenario.  Not to worry, I have VPN.... no wait I don't.  
Return home some days later to find the opnsense router crashed because I hadn't capped my adguard and firewall logs, and it finally ran out of disk space.... facepalm and lesson learnt!  

Don't worry, you'll return home eventually and find some silly cause.

  Comment: Had the same issue I used my home servers to work on remotely for a Linux environment. But one day I couldn't reach it with SSH so couldn't work for half the day and had to drive home and find out my ISP changed my IP so my DNS didn't work. 

Now I use a dedicated server instead a bit more expensive vs the electricity bill for one server but feels more reliable for work as it hosts all my projects and I have support and information when something goes down.
