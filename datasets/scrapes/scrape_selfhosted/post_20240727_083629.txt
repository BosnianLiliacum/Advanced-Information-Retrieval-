Hi!, I am new here. 

I noticed that lately I am using more alternatives to popular apps with self-hosting (ex: docmost alternative to notion). I am using railway almost a year but also, I am open to other providers. I know that many of them using aws or gce under the hood but pricing is diverse. 

So what are you using or recommending as a provider? (buying a physical machine is not an option due to economical conditions right now :( )

Well, that would be... you.  Hence, the self-hosting part.  :P

  
So glad I did this, my own domains, mail, etc.  I love it. So many people complain about self-hosting mail and claim it to be a pain in the ass.  The only 'hard' part was initializing everything which wasn't even hard, just took some time.  After that, I don't even need to touch anything unless I'm updating.

  Comment: I thought self-hosting meant you bought or created your own physical server .. guess not.  🤔

  Comment: I like Hetzner a lot - they seem pretty transparent about many of their decisions, pricing is okay - I have not needed support myself but it’s also supposed to be good.
Also many different models of VPS/storage/dedicated machines etc

  Comment: Try oracle cloud, their free tier is plentiful. But be aware they might close your account for any reason they want. 

Mine is running for 2 years now.
