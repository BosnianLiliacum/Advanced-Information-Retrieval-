Hi, I’m currently rebranding my business. One of the services I provide is web hosting. I’m using a VPS which is running Plesk.

I’m looking for self-hosted apps to make my business administration easier. I’m currently paying for DigibTW (a Dutch accounting program) and the license for Plesk. I have Uptime Kuma running for uptime management, but this is getting really slow because of the many sites.

Do you guys have any recommendations for the following services:

- Bookkeeping for multiple businesses with a gateway via Mollie (invoicing/quotes would be separate if possible)
- Uptime management with the possibility to notify me/client if a site is down. Preferably via my WhatsApp business (is a other software can do this part please let me know)
- A portal for web hosting with automated account creation in Plesk and billing (something like Fossbilling or similar) with the possibility to order via my site
- Something I’m forgetting but is really useful to have

As I mentioned earlier, I have a VPS for the webhosting. I’m also running a home server with Ubuntu and Docker/Portainer.

Looking forward to your replies!
