Hi,

  
I need if exist, an RSS Feed, that when there are some new articles, search this movie in plex, and if is available, skip o give me an alert o something like that, i didn't have this content.

  
For example, i have an rss feed for a website, and now is available Matrix 1999 2160p.

In my plex I have Matrix 1999 in 1080p, o i never had it.

So rss feed tell me that I can upgrade o i didn't have this content.

  
Exist something like that?

  Comment: I setup FreshRSS, but I don't understand how to search a movie, when is available for example in hdencode and search it in my plex, to see if I have already in a good quality, or not, then get links and add into jdownloader.

  
Example:

I have in my Plex Matrix 1999 1080p.mkv   
In hdencode rssfeed come out today Matrix 1999 2160p.mkv

  
How can i check in my plex Matrix automatically ? And check that i don't have for example the 2160p?

And how can I get links from rssfeed about hdencode? ( I can't see any links inside FreshRSS to download )
