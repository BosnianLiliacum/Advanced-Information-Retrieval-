  Comment: I believe [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/) was made for exactly that. I use it for ebooks and it works really well.

  Comment: That's really interesting, I guess a boruu-style site could be what you're looking for, youcould find a way to display collections of magas. Boruus are a way of making an image hosting website (the best known is... rule34 but you absolutely can make something with a similar interface but catered towards hosting mangas)

EDIT : or maybe something like a digital bookshelf : [https://libreselfhosted.com/search/?q=manga](https://libreselfhosted.com/search/?q=manga)
