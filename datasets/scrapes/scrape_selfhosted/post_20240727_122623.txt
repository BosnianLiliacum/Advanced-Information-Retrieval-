**Hello !**

I've been following the reddit for 2 years, to build my homelab and I'd like to thank the community for their precious advice! I'm just a silent redditor but today I'm creating this post to present you a project, which was made first to meet my needs in terms of ergonomics or functionality, the project is in alpha completely open-source, container-ready, and the pride of seeing someone use it will be my only prize!

Of course, if you can provide feedback, report bugs, suggest features so that we can improve the project together, I'd be more than delighted!

**It's a ReactJS/NodeJS/MongoDB budget manager:**

[https://github.com/KayatoSan/Budget5S](https://github.com/KayatoSan/Budget5S)

There are 3 components/mechanics:

* Account: Your bank account or piggy bank with an initial balance.
* Bucket: A bucket, as its name suggests, is for defining a budget. For example, a “Restaurant” bucket can be defined with a monthly amount to be reached, or on the contrary, without an amount depending on the importance of the bucket to keep flexibility. A “Restaurant” bucket can afford to be without an amount, while a “Rent” bucket will have to have a fixed monthly amount (or at your own risk :wink:).
* Vault: To build up your financial security or for other specific needs, you can either define it as a monthly requirement without worrying about the total amount (e.g., I want to save €100 every month) or with a predefined total amount (I want to save €10,000 by the end of the year). The amount required to reach this goal will be calculated and displayed for each month. Vaults are linked to an account, which is important for transfers, as you will see below.

To manage your accounts, buckets, and vaults, you can:

* Make a transaction on your account, to remove or add money with a label (for example: Salary - €2,500) or even to notify an unexpected money transfer, for example, if you're giving money to a relative and there's no bucket or vault for it.
* Transaction vaults: If you want to transfer money to your vault, the “transaction vaults” will ask you from which source account to withdraw the money, for which vault. The operation will be recorded in the vault, and the money from the source account will be transferred to the account linked to the vault!
* And finally, you have the expenses. The goal is simple: you indicate the account that you have used, the bucket in which the expense belongs (Restaurant, rent, shopping, etc.).

*I hope you enjoy it and that it helps someone in their budget management! Respectfully*

  Comment: I suppose it's yet another non zero-based budgeting project.  
Is it really that majority of people use buckets ?
