I am looking for a free open source modern knowledgebase website script that can be installed on a shared web hosting environment.

Here is some of the features that I would like the script to have it possible:

1. Easy WYSIWYG editor
2. Ability to upload media and images for documentation purposes to attach in articles
3. Simple and clean theme that supports dark mode and other theme customizations that allow me to match overall product theming.
4. Password protected KB site, with possibly a user auth to view the site.
5. Responsive Design for mobile viewing.

Can you please give me some options here. I am not oppose to paying, but I am on a budget not looking for monthly or yearly costs, possibly one time under $70

  Comment: You might want to check out OpenKB; it's open-source, user-friendly, and has a clean design with customizable themes. For creating comprehensive visual documentation, I've found Guidde super helpful  it lets you quickly create how-to videos and embed them anywhere.
