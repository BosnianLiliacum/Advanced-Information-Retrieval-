Hi. I'm trying to find a way where I can run 2 instances of the same game on my one computer while I play one of them and my friend remotely joins the other one but still utilizing my pcs recourses (mainly the gpu) so far ive thought abt setting up a VM like hyper-v and enabling gpu passthrough as I've heard hyper-v allows for that. Then I thought of either letting him use the VM through remote desktop connection but I'm thinking running a dedicated cloud gaming software like Parsec would probably make for a smoother experience... But then again I have no idea if this will work, in theory it should.. And thoughts that might help me out with this?

  Comment: You should take a look at this [tool](https://github.com/jamesstringerparsec/Easy-GPU-PV). On the books, consumer-grade GPUs are not eligible and can't be used as a passthrough in Hyper-V officially. The tool allows you to unlock the restriction by using the tech in WSL2 and Windows Sandbox to allow for a consumer GPU to be used as a passthrough.  It makes GPU partitioning in Hyper-V a lot easier and pre-installs Parsec on the VM.  CraftComputing did an awesome [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLLcc29EZ_8) on it and walks you through on getting it set up. It took me less than an hour to get it up and running.

Be aware that through this method however, some anti-cheat software that are kernel-based and are picky with the use of VMs such as Valorant, Apex Legends, R6, etc cannot be played and won't launch properly, if at all, on the Hyper-V VM.

  Comment: [DUO](https://github.com/DuoStream) is a possibility for this but you would have to setup the remote connection separately (suggest a VPN like [Zero-tier](https://www.zerotier.com/) if looking for ease of setup). I also saw this (on [selfh.st](http://selfh.st) ) [Games on Whales](https://games-on-whales.github.io/?ref=selfh.st)
