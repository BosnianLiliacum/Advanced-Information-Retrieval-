If you just want to see it in action, I’m hosting a stream now here [~https://saito.io/swarmcast/~](https://saito.io/swarmcast/?dream=eDhFVkJGY3k2aDd5VmMyTVpaRlNLSndDQWF2YktzN2hiS243TndjaVFXWXY=) (the one with the cats). Keep in mind this is in beta, and we’re still fixing issues, but the tech roughly works.

It’s a P2P livestreaming system called Swarmcast. Key points:

* Pure P2P architecture
* No logins required
* Open-source
* Scalable design

Technical overview:

* Host broadcasts directly to initial peers
* Subsequent peers form a branching network, relaying the stream
* Uses STUN for peer discovery
* Public/private keypairs for user authentication

Current focus: Improving stability at scale, particularly handling peer disconnections and UI.

The project aims to provide an independent alternative to centralized streaming platforms, with added video and screen sharing capabilities.
