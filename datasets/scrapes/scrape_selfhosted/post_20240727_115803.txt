Hello I have Debian 11 server with dedicated public IP, and I want to host a mail server, I do not know what to use and how to set it up? Do you even recommend it?

I set up my mail server about 3 or 4 years ago and have had no problems so far. Try it and you will see that self hosting a mail server is not as difficult as many say.

  Comment: If you have to ask, no, it is not recommended. 

*Why* do you want to host a mail server? What are you going to do with it? 

Michael W. Lewis has just written a book "Run Your Own Mail Server" that's about to be released. If you're determined to do this, that's probably a good place to start. https://mwl.io/nonfiction/tools#ryoms
