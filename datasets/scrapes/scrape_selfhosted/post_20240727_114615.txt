Hi there, WordPress people! I just wanted to show you a ~~quick~~ doc that’s been in the works for about 10 years now.

Okay, we didn’t spend a whole decade making the doc itself, but the data in it did take 10 years to collect. It’s all based on 8 separate surveys we ran on WPShout(.com) from 2014 to 2024.

[~https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pbi1Jpftdx6BSBkC1z6iM1FL\_yZY5yBmk1Bk14E4z8/edit?usp=sharing~](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pbi1Jpftdx6BSBkC1z6iM1FL_yZY5yBmk1Bk14E4z8/edit?usp=sharing)

The surveys are all about WordPress hosting and who the top companies are – according to real users.

The way these surveys work is that every 1-2 years we repeat the survey to get the freshest feedback and see where the hosting market is going for WordPress. The questions are (nearly) the same every year – we ask users about who they host with, what they think of this host and how likely they are to recommend it.

The doc I’m sharing is a 120+ page roundup of data, covering things like:

* who the most popular web host is over the years
* which host gets the highest rating – and did this change 2014 to now
* popular web hosts from country to country
* whether hosting users care for performance or not
* what the average hosting bill is for users
* how many sites people host on average, and more



In the doc, we’re also linking to raw data files in case you want to download those and put them through some pivot tables yourself (shoutout to Excel gurus(!)).

Oh, and heads up – we’re not selling anything here. No affiliate links or sneaky stuff, promise. It’s just pure data, charts, and tables, plus some conclusions from each survey – up to your interpretation.

  Comment: Once upon a time I was offered a job at WP-Engine at the time they claimed they were the best and most popular. If they were the best and most popular why did they offer me a job to work in downtown Austin, TX at $27k and except me to live near the office. The closest place I could even find was an hour and a half away. Glad to see they aren’t fully represented in this document.
