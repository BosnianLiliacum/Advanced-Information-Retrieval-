Hi selfhosters peers!

Here's my context. I have a Win10 HTPC that i'm also using for Plex and PRTG (both local installation).  
I wanted to get out of GooglePhoto and try NextCloud, so I installed DockerDesktop.  
Up to now, I was able to keep my local session opened under a non-admin user, for security best practices.  
But now with DockerDesktop, being on a non-admin sessions is causing problems.  
I'm starting thinking about running this win10 HTPC under a local-admin user session with some kindof firewall hardening.

Anyone running an admin session under a Win10 hosting machine ? Can you share your experience? :)

Oh and yes I know, running Docker under a linux would resolve the problem but my big storage HDD are on this Win10 computer soooo ;)

Any what's the problem there? Simply access that storage via your Plex container. CIFS and NFS are a thing 😉.
