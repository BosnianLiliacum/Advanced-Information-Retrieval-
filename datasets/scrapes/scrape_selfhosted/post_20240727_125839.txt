I've got Immich running on my server and imported some photos that were on there. I added the app to my phone and everything from the server appears there, but I can't see any of the photos that are already on my phone. If i take new pictures, they do not appear in Immich. I was expecting it to basically be a 1:1 replacement for Google Photos, am i mistaken? Why is nothing visible? And yes i gave it photo/video permissions in Android.

  Comment: It works for me, on android. Uninstall the app and reinstall the app?
