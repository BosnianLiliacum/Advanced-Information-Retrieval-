Post Content:
I'm running Debian stable, and I would like to be able to check if there is a:

1. new kernel version 
2. new Debian update
3. new Docker CE version

Where can I check and read the release notes prior to updating?

I'll be sitting around and at some point I'll be like "hmmm I should probably do some updates." Then I'll so some updates.

  Comment: I made a simple script to notify me via telegram when new updates are available : https://github.com/ElouanFiore/pLUM
There isn’t any documentation but it’s quite simple and I tried to simplify the deployment with Deb packages and ansible playbook
