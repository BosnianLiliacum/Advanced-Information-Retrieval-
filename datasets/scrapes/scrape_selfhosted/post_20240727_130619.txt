I think that if there is an AA-style group for people who are addicted to setting up and configuring their home lab, I might be a candidate. I've just had an incredibly fun journey (re)setting up my home lab and have just realized that I'm not sure what to do next. I've completed much more than I really expected - portainer, tailscale, traefik, pi-hole, vaultwarden, plex, immich, homepage and so on. I actually started thinking about starting over with casaos just to have something to do but I realized that is a sign I have problems :)

  Comment: No matter what we do, wives are going to complain. So, I'm not sure this is better than the alternative of....drinking? 
Although, Why not do both!
