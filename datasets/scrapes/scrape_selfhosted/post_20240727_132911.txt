The title is quite obvious, but I have looked into a few options and find it difficult to figure out the differences, pros, and cons between the different options. Thus, I am asking if any of you have any experiences with anything similar. I live within the EU and would like to utilise the PSD2 benefits. My goal is not necessarily to make budgets, but gain an overview of spendings, categorizing transactions, and similar.

So far I have looked into [Actual Budget](https://github.com/actualbudget/actual), [Maybe](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe), and [Firefly III](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii). All of these have integrations with GoCardless, and I find it difficult to choose between them. Anyone who would like to share their potential experiences, or if they have experiences with any other similar applications?

  Comment: it really depends on your needs. If your doing zero budget then either of those you mentioned are solid canditates although i had a personal hate relationship with Actual Budget, i think its just overly complex to use unless your happy with one month at a time budgetting.

For me, i gave up looking after countless installs from so many and have continued to use Anmoney, a 15 year old android app that has never let me down. With Anmoney i can input my recurring and incoming expense, whether that be weekly, monthly, yearly, every second week, whatever, and then predict my finiance based on that. I kinda envelope budget within it, assigning expense to  categories (i.e Rent, gas/electric, water, council tax, car etc) and from that, as its just classed as a recurring payment, i can report on my finiance based on that. So if i assign say £500 a month to a holiday saving, i can have a report that will tell me what that amount will be in x amount of months from now, even years if i want to. Its a great system that i've not seen replicated in ANY android, online or even self hosted app since (i've tried so many to replicate it and replace it).

  Comment: I started using [Beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount) recently and really like it. It has a relatively steep learning curve, though, and requires some basic programming experience to set up.

Other similar open source options are [GnuCash](https://www.gnucash.org/), [ledger](https://ledger-cli.org/), and [hledger](https://hledger.org/). They are all based on the double-entry accounting system.

I keep it pretty simple and just track one credit card and one checking account, using [beancount-import](https://github.com/jbms/beancount-import) to import transactions from manually downloaded ofx files once or twice a month. Beancount has a nice web interface too, [fava](https://github.com/beancount/fava), and even its own [query language](https://beancount.github.io/docs/beancount_query_language.html).

You can learn more about all of these tools over at [r/plaintextaccounting](https://www.reddit.com/r/plaintextaccounting/). I should probably add a warning that it’s a bit of a rabbit hole. But I’m happy with my setup, and have tried a lot of different personal finance software, both open- and closed-source. The tooling actually makes what’s otherwise a relatively boring exercise fun, for me at least.

  Comment: Actual budget user for over a year. I have been using excel files previously. I really really like the app. But I suggest to first read about enveloped based budgeting!
