  Comment: I have a script on github (https://github.com/lordzeuss/auto-authelia) where I use bash scripts to guide the user to being able to quickly spin up authelia.

I personally am learning rust, and built a gui example as something that I'm looking into adding to the project. Is this all that useful, or do you all prefer just a simple script?

The gui is by no means complete, as I want to add more features to it (for example - adding hashing capabilities built-in so you don't have to do it externally at a website) but it's a proof of concept, and just a small project for myself. It's also not part of the main report yet - need to complete it. 

Those of you who may use my project for setting up authelia, would you use a gui, or just stick to the good 'ol bash script(s)?

Thanks!

  Comment: The problem is - GUI that is created by 3rd party for security app is... well. Even if you don't have any malicious intent - it doesn't mean that your app wouldn't introduce additional security vulnerabilities

  Comment: Authelia is on my list to add. I didn’t know about these scripts but I would absolutely use a GUI tool to help configure. For me it’s another tool to help with my learning, especially if the GUI spits out a config file of sorts that I could compare to my own or to the official docs as I attempt to build my own. I imagine it would also be useful if someone was attempting to troubleshoot. 

I setup Caddy yesterday and while their docs are great I stumbled on where to put the tls line for cloud flare api for my reverse proxy (before, after, in, etc). If there were a GUI that I could have configured with those settings and compared to my own that I was working on it might have helped guide me. 

As an aside, after some trial and error I did get it to work and damn it felt good seeing my site pop up on the web with a real domain.

  Comment: It depends. I'd love to have something that just generates the configuration with comments so that I could review it beforehand.


Maybe even for different IDM/OAuth solutions as I migrated from Authelia to [Kanidm](https://kanidm.com/).

  Comment: No, definitely not. I wouldn't trust it to get edge cases right and I would be concerned that the result wouldn't necessarily be something I could bring into my config as code pipelines which automate my stacks.

  Comment: Every reply comment here saying no, as if every fucking post in here isn't low quality wanting a GUI for everything.

Yes, do it and these nerds will use it and more than likely be back in here begging for features.
