Has anyone found an open source CasaOS like NAS software that has built-in support for btrfs/zfs snapshots? 

I'm basically looking to have the capability to restore files from snapshots and have an easy way to manage the file restores, snapshot browsing. Synology makes this very easy.

* CasaOS | ZimaOS doesn't support snapshots. It does offer a nice web UI file browser which would be ideal...   
* TrueNAS scale offers capabilities to enable automatic zfs snapshots but I don't think it offers a web based file browser OR a macOS integration like in windows SMB that allows you to view `Restore previous versions` (pls lmk if i am wrong?)

Making my proxmox server become my NAS seems to be straightforward and easy enough but I am missing a solution for how to have easy ways to recover my data if I do something stupid... Hopefully someone here may have figure out a clever way to fix this gap?
