Hello, I am looking to use the qnap tvs 6 bay thunderbolt nas to host an Ark Survival Evolved server. How can I utilize the ram of the qnap and keep it running 24/7? 

Right now, I can only seem to get the server to use the ram of my laptop plugged into it. Which is maxing out my asus zenbook pro. I’m very new to Nas’s and I got one for a video editing business. Hoping to use it to host a server as an added bonus. 
 
Any help is appreciated. Thank you

  Comment: I don't think you can, and even if you can, it has an old i5 and 8gb of ram, I don't think it's enough for running an Ark server.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but for me this sounds rather like the server is installed/running on your notebook and not on the qnap.

More Information is definitely needed here.

AFAIK you have 2 possibilities:
- Set up a VM to run the ARK server on
- Install a Docker Image
