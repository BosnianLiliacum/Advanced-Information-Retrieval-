I'm really struggling to get Mastodon to work at all. I've tried both in Docker Compose, and on "bare metal" Ubuntu/Debian VMs, and an LXC. I just want a single user instance so I can have my username be my domain.

I really struggle to get the docker containers set up and talking to each other. I'm following the compose files exactly but keep getting database errors etc.

The bare metal guides either seem to be outdated for old versions of Mastodon that use old versions of Ruby, Node, etc, or they have a hugely complex NGINX config file that sets up the custom domain, SSL, etc. I don't want that, I already have cloudflare tunnels and caddy reverse proxy configured on another machine, I literally just want Mastodon running on a local IP and port I can point caddy to, but none of the guides seem to be able to set that up.

  Comment: Do you want mastodon specifically or do you want an activitypub server? For a single user instance I'd recommend GoToSocial which is specifically built for small instances. The developers host their instance on a 1 Core machine:) I run it happily for over a year and it has a lot of neat features missing from mastodon.

  Comment: Will be hard to help without knowing the actual errors, Focus on 1 install method. Try again and post the step wich doesnt work with the correspinding config files and errors.

  Comment: I've set up mine with yunohost, most of the things can be configured in the ui, specific settings have to be done in the terminal. I run a matrix and mastodon server this way. 

It's a bit complicated/confusing to setup yunohost itself if you use it the first time, but after that it works without a problem. Installing mastodon is then just a click and a few parameters in the web ui away.
