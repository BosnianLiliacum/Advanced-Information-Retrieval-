Hi, I pay for a domain name through Ionos and want to update the DNS records to point to a protonmail back end. I don't want to serve any webpages through the domain at this point. 

Currently the domain is redirecting to one of those awful spammy autogenerated placeholder pages. I looked at my admin console and there's like 12 DNS record entries that I assume are preconfigured by Inonos to serve both the spammy placeholder site and are preconfigured to point to Ionos web mail which I don' pay for. I see MX, CNAME, AAA, A, TXT records which all have some `_______.ionos.com` in the record.

I'm guessing it's common practice for cheap domain name hosts to set themselves up to push you into bundles and/or default to their content in the absence of my content.

Can I delete all the records out of there with no ill effect? What are the bare minimal records I should have in preparation for loading protonmail's MX records? I really just want the bare minimal for functional DNS resolution.

  Comment: IONOS documentation and support, plus Protonmail documentation and support. Thats what youre paying them for.

You could delete all records and then add only the ones that Protonmail requires.

  Comment: Just delete it all. Protonmails documentation should walk you though exactly which records you have to add, it'll be a combination of mx and txt records.
