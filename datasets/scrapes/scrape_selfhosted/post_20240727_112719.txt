I'm looking for some pre-built small boxes which can serve me well with my selfhosted services (almost all of them being docker based), besides Home Assistant which runs right now in it's own VM.  
  
I'm running all my selfhosted needs right now on the Synology which works just fine. Nevertheless running this machine 24/7 is a bit pricy and it's also an AMD cpu which is not ideal for Plex transcoding. Therefor I'm looking for an additional low-energy (intel based) system which I can run (mostly) all services on. The synology definitely stays in the house as a storage monster. The idea is to run Home Assistant and other services which are 24/7 relevant on the low energy system and only boot up the Synology box at daytime.

I'm not sure if it's possible to achieve some kind of energy saving with this strategy but let's find out...

Thanks for some recommendations folks.

  Comment: The most recommended boxes I see at the moment are running Intel N100's.

If your impatient, there are dozens of different boxes on Amazon, though if you can wait, you can pick-up a bare-bones box from Ali Express for (i.e. add your own RAM and storage) for half the price.
