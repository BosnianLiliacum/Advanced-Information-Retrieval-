Hey there!

I am now using VDOCipher and their absurd prices, I didn't know self-hosting was an option.

I am not talking about strictly self-hosting, AWS is enough.

1) How do I get the keys? Widevine website is super vague and doesn't point anywhere for getting started, or am I missing something?

2) How how do I encrypt the video? is it a one time thing (ergo S3 sufficient), or per-view encryption? GPT points me towards Shaka Packager, is it fine?

3) How can I ensure it is L1 proper and doesn't fall back to some L1 without me knowing about it?

Thanks a lot.
