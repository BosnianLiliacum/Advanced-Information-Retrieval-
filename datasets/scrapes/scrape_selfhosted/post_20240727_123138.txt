Currently working on replacing a dual NUC with ESX and a 8 bay QNAP NAS for one big homelab server.

The new server will be running Proxmox, mainly for the lab VM's.  
Proxmox runs from a sSATA controller. VM's will be stored on a dual NVME setup.   
  
Of course I still need NAS functionality, so I want to run Truenas in a VM with PCIe passthrough of the (second) builtin SATA controller (using ZFS).

So far so good and quite straightforward.

Next, for the userdata.  
Mainly for easy file sync (Qsync alternative) and mobile support I want to run Nextcloud.

Since Truenas stopped supporting TrueCharts (May 30, 2024) running Nextcloud inside Truenas cannot be done (and might aswell be a bad idea anyway).

Installing Nextcloud in LXC is easy and works very nice.   
But I'm struggling with the location of the userdata.  
  
I would like to have all data inside Truenas (using the passthrough SATA Controller with ZFS) preventing me to use separate disks and/or 'virtual disks' served from Proxmox.  
What would be the best way to make these 2 (3 including Proxmox) work together?

Truenas NFS share for Nextcloud? Or just SMB?   
Suggestions are welcome
