**For example, entering:**

`docker run -d --name quakejs -e HTTP_PORT=&lt;HTTP_PORT&gt; -p &lt;HTTP_PORT&gt;:80 -p 27960:27960 treyyoder/quakejs:latest`

**Will convert to:**

`version: '3.7'`



`services:`

  `quakejs:`

`image: treyyoder/quakejs:latest`

`container_name: quakejs`

`environment:`

`- HTTP_PORT=&lt;HTTP_PORT&gt;`

`ports:`

`- "&lt;HTTP_PORT&gt;:80"`

`- "27960:27960"`

`restart: always`

You also have additional options such as mapping ports, volumes and custom environment variables.

  Comment: This is cool, thanks! I like the extra options beyond just converting the run cmd to compose.
