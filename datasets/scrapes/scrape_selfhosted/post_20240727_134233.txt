I'm writing a self-hosted AI chatbot (not trying to win any awards or break the SOTA, just experimenting for a fun side project and to learn the technologies).

The way its currently set up, the chatbot calls a python API I built, which directly calls an ollama API running on my machine. I wanted to add a queue to buffer between the two, though I mostly care about the fact I will need to wait on the AI if multiple messages come in before the first one is done processing/generating.

I want to do the whole thing hosted locally (I have a server with a 12 gb 3060 GPU for the AI stuff), so I was wondering what sorts of queues/workers I could set up with python and/or docker to handle that use case.

I don't mind if it's not the most efficient way to do it, but I would prefer it to be relatively simple to use after setting it up.

If there are whole projects that handle the retrieval augmentation, queuing, and generation, I might be willing to just switch to that instead.

Let me know if this isn't the right sub to put this in.

This should work. It will use redis very simple queue.

  Comment: Redis has built in queuing. It's bare bones but does work

  Comment: Try [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/index.html). You can use it with Rabbit or Redis as a broker using docker. It is fast, distributed, very flexible, docs provide examples of patterns for use with docker. I have had success with this approach and found it fairly easy to get started.

  Comment: What's wrong with a FIFO queue? Just use a list doesn't get simpler than that, append and pop(0).
