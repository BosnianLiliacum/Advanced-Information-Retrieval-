Post Content:
I don't realyl want to self host a mail server (unless i really really really need to).

But What is the best ways to get various notifications from my server (proxmox + guest VM's)?

for most of my domains i use Migadu, they do have a send limit to X per day/month.

I would like to get mails from my servers, for various stuff.. like perhaps todays fail2ban info;s. Info of status of borg backup (or similar stuff), failed 2fa/sso/other stuff.

  Comment: I used to run a postfix smtp relay to send smtp from apps, servers and services to myself via a Gmail relay, I never ran into any issues. I switched to ntfy instead, fantastic app. https://ntfy.sh/

  Comment: Are you specifically looking for email? I use telegram for all my notifications. The api is really simple and there's a bunch of integrations for the services I run.

  Comment: I use sendpulse, it's free for the volume you will need.  I use it only for notification alerts.
