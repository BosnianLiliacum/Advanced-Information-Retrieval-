Hey everyone, I am a contributor to [CopilotKit](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit), an open-source framework for building in-app AI copilots &amp; other features.

We just launched our version 1.0 and the library is really coming together as a powerful open-source resource for AI web development

Here's some of what's new in the v1.0:

1. Fully customizable generative UI.
2. React components for AI chatbots, AI textareas &amp; Agents.
3. New GraphQL powered protocol that makes it easier to contribute &amp; extend.
4. Cloud Beta for an easier deployment of the runtime.

Here's the full [change log](https://ai88.substack.com/p/copilotkit-v1-launch).

The library is fully open-sourced under MIT license and self host-able. We're still looking for more features to add, happy to hear your thoughts :)
