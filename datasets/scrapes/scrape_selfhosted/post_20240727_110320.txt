Hi! Maybe a long shot, but I'll ask anyway.

I'm from the US, but visiting family in Hong Kong. My brother has asked about setting up a server to back up their data. Anyone in this sub live in HK and can help me with where to go and what prices are decent? 

We went to the place in Sham Sui Po and got a quote from a system builder, but I'm wondering if there is a better place to go or if the guy is ripping us off. My HK family is fairly computer illiterate so they're not familiar with this stuff.

(Yes I'm well aware of the pitfalls of setting up a server for family/friends and have accepted that I'll be tech support.)

Edit: 

Should probably add what the quote was. 

CPU Intel i3-12100, mobo B760M, 16gb ddr4 ram, 512gb nvme SSD, 550w power supply, total $3080

Adding 3x 16tb drives for $1900 each

(Prices are in HKD)

  Comment: I bought my first computer in Hong Kong in 1991! I believe it was a 286 at 8Mhz. Bought it from Kowloon whilst living in Shatin. Great times.
