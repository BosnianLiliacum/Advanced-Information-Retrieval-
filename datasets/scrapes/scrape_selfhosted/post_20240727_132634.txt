I'm about to revamp my home server, was wondering what you're all using to containerise your services (or are you not?) - and what would be the recommendation for someone just starting out.  
Thanks :)

EDIT: I see there's a bunch of votes but no comments, if you wouldn't mind telling me \*why\* you suggest what you suggest, that'd be grand

  Comment: If you're new, use Docker. Podman doesn't have a daemon, so it won't automatically restart your containers after a reboot, without some special configuration.

  Comment: I voted Docker, but my comprehensive answer is: "Choose whichever you feel most up to using and maintaining."

I personally use Docker for these reasons.

* compose
* With or without compose, Docker seems much more usable and approachable than Podman.
* I prefer to run my containers with a daemon. In a homelab/home server setting, the user isolation of running daemonless isn't as compelling, since you likely won't use more than one user to run containers.
* The additional setup required to make Docker run rootless doesn't require much effort, and it's a one-time thing.
* There's way more community support for Docker.

  Comment: I like podman nowadays because podman-quadlet allows integration container integration into systemd. 

That way it can handle restarting services, automatically updating, and stuff like that.

If you use podman make sure it is a very new version.

  Comment: I like Podman, but Docker is by far easier to get into. Docker has more resources online to help.

  Comment: Try everything, man. Stop trying to be perfect from the jump (spoiler: perfect for you is not perfect for me or the next guy)


You don't have customers, you don't have to worry about SLA agreements. Try it all.

  Comment: Docker. Documentation is much better, stack/compose support and 1st class Portainer.io support.
