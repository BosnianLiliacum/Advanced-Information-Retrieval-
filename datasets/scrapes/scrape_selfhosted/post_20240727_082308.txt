  Comment: without knowing how big your swap is, its impossible to know how much 93% of your swap actually is.

It's normal to use a little bit of swap in any memory configuration.

Also, there had previously been memory pressure on the machine since it was most recently booted - it might have swapped a bunch of stuff out at the time

...and then unless there was any need to swap it back in - it would stay swapped out even when the pressure dropped.

  Comment: I’m glad that you posted this because I noticed it as well and feared I’d be laughed out of reddit for asking. Thank you

  Comment: Debian is very swap-happy by default, I always set swappiness to 0 on mine so it can still swap if necessary but doesn’t just dump everything into swap as soon as it’s been idle for a few minutes.

  Comment: Something might be reading/writing files more frequently than the data some program put in memory. So the kernel decided to swap that data to make more space for caching.

Also, some program might at some point ballooned and use lots of memory, pushing data off to swap. 

The data in swap will remain there until the program that owns it actually uses it. If its just forgotten it will remain there until the program is closed.
