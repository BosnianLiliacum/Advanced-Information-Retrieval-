Hi,

i'm having trouble running the combo nextcloud, mariaDB and the reverse-proxy SWAG as docker containers inside unraid at home. 

Everything seems to work fine inside my network, so there are no technical issues with nextcloud and mariaDB, but when going live using swag, the browser quits with '**error: too many redirects**'. When checking the URL in [redirect-checker.org](http://redirect-checker.org) a quick check of my site produces a hell lot of '**301 moved permanently**'. 

As [https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/troubleshooting/too-many-redirects/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/troubleshooting/too-many-redirects/) states, this might be caused by SSL misconfigurations. To get this off my checklist, i need to know, how to delete an SSL certificate on a swag instance running on a docker in unraid. 

* Does anyone know where this file is located exactly? 
* Is it safe to delete it and restart swag to renew the certificate?

Thank you so much for helping me out!

  Comment: on a webserver the .htaccess rewrites can also cause this.

  Comment: I believe you can fix this by setting the Cloudclare certificate to either Flexible or Strict, one of those two, I just forget which one it is.
