does anyone know how to set this up i think my problem is with the ngxpm but im not sure.

everytime i try to access netbird i get this from authentik

The request fails due to a missing, invalid, or mismatching redirection URI (redirect\_uri).

and maybe its because of this i dont know how to set up this in NGXPM

  Comment: In the settings for the oauth2 provider you use for netbird, you need to add:

Http(s)://yourdomain.com
Http(s)://yourdomain.com.*
Http://localhost.*

Localhost needs to be there for some reason

Edit: sorry about the formatting, each entry should be on a separate line
