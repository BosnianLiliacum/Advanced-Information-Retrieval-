Looking for advice on what I should use to host a family photo contribution library. I'd like relatively tech-unsavvy family members, many of whom don't live near me (so I can't set up their devices for them, etc), to be able to contribute and share photos and videos. 

I run a homelab (SFF proxmox + a Synology NAS that I won't expose directly... too much important stuff on it to risk) that's currently only accessible via Wireguard, but I would consider opening up this specific service with a port and DNS name, reverse proxy, or cloud hosting if that's better in the long run... but I hate recurring bills, just like many of you. 

So what should I use?

  Comment: Use Tailscale, easy as installing random software from online. You can share access to their accounts and you control what access they have on your tailnet.
