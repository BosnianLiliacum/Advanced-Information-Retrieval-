Post Content:
I was tired of visiting unreliable third-party sites for YouTube video files, so I made a local app that lets you download them directly to your home machine.

With the app you can download the mp4 files from nearly any YouTube video or YouTube Short, except for age-restricted content (login required, not supported yet in the app).

Some highlights:

* **Python** and **Docker** versions available.
* Choose your video resolution
* Apache 2.0 open source license.
* Try it now in browser  --&gt; [https://huggingface.co/spaces/neonwatty/youtube\_downloader](https://huggingface.co/spaces/neonwatty/youtube_downloader)
* Visit the repo --&gt; [https://github.com/neonwatty/youtube\_downloader](https://github.com/neonwatty/youtube_downloader)

**Notice: Material downloaded via the app is intended for personal use only.  This app should not be used for distributing copyrighted content.**

  Comment: Some people are poopooing OP for making something that doesn't fit their use case, it's okay not everything is for everyone, but at least be constructive.

OP, I think you may want to change somethings to market your project better to the community. You are calling it a "locally hosted YouTube MP4 downloader" which is true, but people already have that. I think you should be a little more forward with how it is to be used, I think you should tell people that it is something like "A simple browser based frontend for yt-dlp". 

Personally, I think it is neat. I also think you could get a lot of traction if you made it so you could create 'download presets' where you could use simple checkboxes/menus so you could visually set the arguments for yt-dlp, and arrange what quality and format you want to download the video in in order of most to least preferred. I find the man page daunting and it's a pain in the ass to craft commands that are 2000 characters long that do what I want, I've been thinking of making something similar to what you have with this functionality for a long time!

  Comment: Is it possible to download a video with its multiple audio tracks when it has more than one language? Could I also download its transcript and description page?

  Comment: This looks very promising, I was looking for a solution like Invidious but would run on an old pi. Invidious doesn't run on Arm and is quite heavy on resources.
