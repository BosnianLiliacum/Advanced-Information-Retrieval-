Basically title.

USE CASE: I’d like to view/edit a directory of plain text notes (Markdown) that lives on an SSH server, from my iPhone. Ideally, I may even like to give others to access/view some subset of these files. But they have to be plain text files (not DB records) because they get synced to my laptop, where I edit them (sometimes offline) in a regular text editor.

ALTERNATIVES I’VE CONSIDERED:

* **an iOS text editor app with SFTP support (Textastic, GTW)**  
  Might be fine, but I’d prefer FOSS
* **Obsidian for iOS**  
  Only supports sync via icloud and Obsidian Sync; I am syncing with Syncthing
* **HedgeDoc, Etherpad**  
  I’m under the impression these store docs as DB records; would love to be misinformed on this point

Any leads would be greatly appreciated 🙇🙇🙇

  Comment: Have you checked the side bar of this Reddit? Under useful links are lists of project's that you can selfhost. There maybe one there that fits your needs.

Why is this not a viable solution?

Hope that helps.
