The title pretty much says it all. I’m most comfortable in an Ubuntu environment, but overall am pretty flexible.

Docker would be nice. Will likely need to be exposed externally for ease of use.

  Comment: When I see people wanting a servicedesk home, is does make me wonder, if we're missing a trick..  I mean, we have the Farming simulator, the Cleaning simulator.... now the ultimate simulator -  SysAdmin Simulator.

Featuring VDSL, borked infrastructure, pissed off users, and for those that aspire to IT Manager... we have Weekend at the CEO's house (installing WIFI...).
