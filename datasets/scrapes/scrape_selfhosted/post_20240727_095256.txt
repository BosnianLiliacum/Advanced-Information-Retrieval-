  Comment: zabbix would be my recommendation, you can configure agents to look through log files and alert you for matches, you can also configure 'web' agents to look for specific strings in web pages

  Comment: Check out sentry.io. Also check out Grafana's other products  —  besides dashboards and logs they also do tracing and profiling.
