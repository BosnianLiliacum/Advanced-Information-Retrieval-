Hey everyone!

I have the following problem: I am using the Authentik oAuth provider to log into HedgeDoc. I already tried to implement a policy in Authentik to bypass specific URLs during the authentik-default-authentification-flow. 

Authentik is running on a VPS behind Traefik and a cloudflared tunnel. Hedgedoc is running on a different VPS, no problems with the authentication process so far.

I only want to able to share publicly available document links with HedgeDoc without anyone seeing the login page of Authentik.

Do you guys have any idea how to solve that problem?

Thanks!

  Comment: If using Proxy Provider or Forward Auth:

[https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/providers/proxy/#allowing-unauthenticated-requests](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/providers/proxy/#allowing-unauthenticated-requests)

Admin Interface &gt; Providers &gt; {HEDGEDOC PROVIDER} &gt; Advanced Protocol Settings &gt; Add the paths you want to ignore auth (regex works)
