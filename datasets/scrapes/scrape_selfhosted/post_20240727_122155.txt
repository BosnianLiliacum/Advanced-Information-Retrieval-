  Comment: If it's not too confidential, what's your use case? If I'm not mistaken, BannerBear is a glorified HTML/CSS to JPG/PNG/PDF service, no? That's something one can achieve "easily" with Gotenberg / Headless Browsers / HTML2Canvas, for example. If your use case isn't too complicated, and if none of the mentioned technologies would fit, I think I could code something for you when I have the time for it.
