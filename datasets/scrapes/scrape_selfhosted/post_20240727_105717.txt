Hello everyone,

I'm currently using Lightroom to manage my photos and would like to transfer this to a self-hosted version in my Proxmoxx. So far I've tried:

Photoprism  
immich  
nextcloud Memories  
Photoview.

immich is probably the closest to this, but unfortunately it only has a simple timeline.  
What I would like now is, in addition to a simple catalog display, a "nice" evaluation based on the metadata, e.g. timeline, today, 1,2,3 years ago today, last trip, etc.

In Lightroom, iam using exif tags for organizing and using the list function from lightroom to manage pics. Until now, i found no selfhostet app, which is using exifs tags in a way like lightroom

It would also be great if the software monitored folders, since the raw image editing still takes place in LR and I would then export them via smb.

  Comment: I find photoprism is better in this respect.  Immich is more set up for good photos replacement + backup.

Where photoprism is a bit more data centric.

  Comment: You should take a look at my app, [Damselfly](https://github.com/webreaper/Damselfly) - it sounds like your use case and workflow are very similar to mine, and the reasons I built it.

It has timeline view, is exif keyword focused, and monitors folders.

  Comment: Can't help ya, but would be worth making a suggestion to the Immich devs to see if it's something they would support.
