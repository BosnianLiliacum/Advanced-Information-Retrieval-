Basically something to help me with my vaction plans for myself and my family. Would be great to have flight automations etc as well but currently using a spreadsheet for location ideas, costs etc so anything better than that is a bonus.

  Comment: Have you tried using Notion or Trello for organizing your vacation plans? They offer great templates and integrations that might suit your needs. If you need to create quick how-to videos for family members on how to use these tools, Ive found Guidde super helpful for making those instructional clips.

  Comment: How do you use tripit and for what features?


I use it, but don't see how I'd use it for location ideas or costs...so not really clear what you want.
