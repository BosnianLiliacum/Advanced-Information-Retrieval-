One thing I have been behind on doing is setting up centralized logging on my network.  I originally wanted to try Grafana &amp; Loki, but I never got much further than the initial setup.  I know Splunk is super popular, but not sure how much the 500MB/day limit will be, now or in the future.

I already have around 60 docker containers, as well as a few VMs and a proxmox cluster along with TrueNAS primary/backup.

I was really interested in Loki due to how it claims to drastically reduce logging space despite keeping the important data.

Is it even possible to get intelligent logging with alerts without paying a fortune for commercial licensing on a small setup?

  Comment: I use Splunk personally. But, do note, My day jobs involves architecting, maintaining, and administrating splunk... so- the skillset was already there.

  Comment: The learning curve for Loki was pretty steep for me, but it was worth it. I now use prometheus/mimir/loki and it works great.

  Comment: If you just have docker containers, and don't want to set up a whole log server, you would probably benefit from Dozzle or ctop.

Dozzle can be run in a docker container, it shows you all your containers/stacks and their logs.

Ctop is just a super simple terminal 'top'-like program that just shows you a clean interface to view usage and logs for each container
