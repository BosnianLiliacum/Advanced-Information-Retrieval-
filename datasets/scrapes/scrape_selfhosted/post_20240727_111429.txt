Hi, I have a 2TB HDD with some (unimportant) videos. I did a zfs scrub on the drive and it said it corrected 400K files and 2K are permanently damaged (most of them are /usr /bin /var ....

Some of my videos are corrupted. Some not. I currently FTP'd into the drive and copy the kinda important ones over to my PC. When the file (video) is not listed in the `zfs status -v`does that mean it is save? Is there a way to check that fast (except watching the entire video)?

  Comment: You can use ffmpeg -v to validate video files, as a starting point.
