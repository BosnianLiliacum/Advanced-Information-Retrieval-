I know there are a ton of these kicking around and I never see anyone mention Readeck.  I honestly love it. Over time, Wallabag just stopped working well for me and it probably took about a year before I stumbled on this one. Currently, I'm just waiting to see integration with some kind of app and oauth support, but the ebook export works for offline and oauth is at least on the roadmap.

Just thought I'd give it a quick shout out - thanks to the devs!

  Comment: It’s the best feature wise but I always get let down by their web scraper, it never returns what it needs to 50% of the time…
