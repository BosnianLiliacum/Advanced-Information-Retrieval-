Hello,   


I was wondering what and how do you archive or keep a copy of your emails from cloud services eg. Gmail, Outlook etc. on your self hosting infrastructure.

My thinking is to have automatically download the emails from those services while being able to access them if needed from that on-prem client/server.  
I was trying to do so with thunderbird but sometimes the emails are not downloaded fully either images or attachments (I think for attachment s there is an option ) but this I have to have a PC open.

My NAS is Sinology and I think it has some type of mail client but have not tested it yet nor have searched further since I though to check what other options there are.

Thank you  
L
