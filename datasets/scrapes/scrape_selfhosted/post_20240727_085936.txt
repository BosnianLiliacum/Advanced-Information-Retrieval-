I have a tarantula and would like to know what it does in the terrarium. (These animals are usually most active at night) Problem: I need a small camera with night vision that fits in the terrarium and transmits video to my server. I would like to transmit the video stream live via my existing docker server and perhaps also run motion detection on the server.  
What hardware and software could I use for this?  
(The environmental parameters are already monitored and controlled via smarthome devices and a script on my server controls this)

  Comment: You can use Frigate (https://github.com/blakeblackshear/frigate) for this, or even Scrypted (https://github.com/koush/scrypted) that can act as NVRs
