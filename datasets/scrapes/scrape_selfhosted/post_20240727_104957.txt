So I want to learn some basic kubernetes because... Why not? I think basic kubernetes is a good skill to have. My issue is that I want to have something that I can take with me (that sounds stupid ik) and always have fun with it. I always carry my pi (pi5 8gb) with me running some basic docker services so I could install k3s directly on it but 1 node cluster is no fun. Then I came across kind a simple cool tool that makes a kubernetes cluster with as many nodes as you want in docker containers! So I've been thinking is that a good enough tool for me to learn some basic kubernetes or does it miss something?

  Comment: With K3D you can spawn any number of node in dockers, great way to learn.
