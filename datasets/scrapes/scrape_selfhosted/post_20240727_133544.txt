Currently I thinking Lychee simply as it's been around for longer and is less complex.

* [immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich)
* [lychee](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee)

Looking at Github Stars, immich is about 10x more than Lychee.

More importantly which app is more secure?

  Comment: They’re different apps for different purposes. 

If you want a google photos type replacement, or to backup/auto upload from your phone, Immich is the one to go for. But it ideally wants a gpu for all the machine learning stuff. 

Lychee as far as I can remember is for managing albums. Like you have to do everything manually.

  Comment: If you're looking for less complex then look at Photoview. Simply point to your existing folder and you're all set.

  Comment: I found Lychee outdated, messy to get going, and extremely underwhelming. Immich by contrast was super easy to set up, has a great and customizable auto upload process. Better management. PhotoPrism is another good one but it's import options aren't as 😊 of, automated backup needs and external app.
