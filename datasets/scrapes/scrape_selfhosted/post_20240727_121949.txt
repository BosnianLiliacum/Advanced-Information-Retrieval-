Is there a single-binary app that can provide system information? I love how easy to setup FileBrowser.org I wish there’s something like that for SysInfo.

  Comment: Edit: looking at your other responses, I think you should try `btop`.

(original comment)

I don't know what you mean by system information.  If you mean running info like the classic `top` then `btop` is a single binary.

If you mean static system info (usually *hardware* info like CPU RAM battery etc) then I use `inxi`.  This is also a single file (but not a *binary* -- it's one humongous perl script!)
