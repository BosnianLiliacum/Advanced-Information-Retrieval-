Post Content:
Are there any bookmark managers which can be self-hosted and are primarily intended not for storing private bookmark collections but rather for curating collections of bookmarks which are intended to be shared with the world at large?

Use-case is something like building up a repository of interesting tech tools which I would like to open-source for anybody else that's into the same tech interests. 

I could create a sprawling network of "Awesome" pages of Gitub, but I'm thinking about ways to do this that don't involve building on somebody else's castle and which I can manage and backup myself.

TIA for any ideas!

I haven't used it myself but have been considering playing around with it.

There are also alternatives but Linkwarden is hands down the best one out there…
