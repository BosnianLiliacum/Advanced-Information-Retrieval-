Hey, I am struggling a lot with this pretty stupid problem.

I am trying to use Storage Box as a kind of "self hosted" Dropbox alternative for my Client friend.

Everything have to be run on Mac machine with storage on HETZNER. The idea is to host everything there with full access when having steady internet connection and as a must is to have ability to set a file as a offline file for use when with no internet connection. Must (could be perfect to) have a GUI.

Tried Nextcloud, but Storage Box is not a Nextcloud based

SeaDrive / SeaFile requires a server

SyncThing does not have selective sync option

SynologyDrive... well, requires Synology

  Comment: Why don‘t you use hetzners storage share? It‘s a managed nextcloud and does exactly what you want…

  Comment: One off cost but mountain duck really was excellent when I was on Mac. 

Super userfriendly which is importent if you’re helping someone else.

It’s a per user licence so can install on as many devices as long as they’re used by one user.

You can use it live on the internet with good connection but also mark folders/files to always be available offline and they sync whenever connection is established.
