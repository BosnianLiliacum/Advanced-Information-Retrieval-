I've got my hand on HP Proliant Gen9 with 2x Nvidia Tesla P100 GPUs (16GB vRAM) - it will arrive within few days.

Purpose is to play with using (not training) AI models (ollama + open webUI etc) 

I want to play with it, maybe code automation agents, funny tools, etc. Just to learn and share with friends.

Are this P100 any good? Or better to not waste my time to try to run stuff on them - sell them and buy single used RTX 4070 12GB (and maybe later next one)?

  Comment: P100 is very solid as it have HBM memory instead of GDDR, and vram capacity &amp; vram speed is everything in ai
