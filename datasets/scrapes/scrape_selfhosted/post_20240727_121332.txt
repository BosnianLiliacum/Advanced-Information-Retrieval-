Hello Reddit

I want to use a rasberry pi 400 to act as a reverse proxy (i think) so that when anyone connects to it via Zero Teir's IP they will see the a local webserver hosted on another device locally connected to the Pi. Would something like this be possible?

And if so, how would i go about it?

Using some google-fu i found Caddy, but im not sure if this is it or not.

I am very new to networking and this is very much a learning experience for me. Feel free to ask me for more info and i will get back to you as soon as i can.
