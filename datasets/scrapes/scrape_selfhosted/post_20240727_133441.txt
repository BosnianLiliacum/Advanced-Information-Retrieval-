Hi everyone,

I'm currently using 1Password through the GitHub Student Pack, which offers a year of free service. However, due to budget constraints, I'm looking for a good alternative, especially one with strong SSH terminal integration.  
I've considered Bitwarden, but I'm not sure if it offers the SSH terminal integration I'm looking for. Any recommendations or experiences with other password managers that meet these criteria would be greatly appreciated!

  Comment: Are you on a mac? It provides a built in ssh agent as well, though to make it seamless you need a tiny script to run at login.
