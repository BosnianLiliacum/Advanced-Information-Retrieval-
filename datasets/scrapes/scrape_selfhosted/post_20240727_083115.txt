  Comment: I don't know if you need this kind of feedback, but I genuinely enjoy reading these. I would love it the same way if it would be posted only every second or third week.

  Comment: Love reading this! Just a question, you used to have a rss feed with the latest software updates which I enjoyed, but that doesn’t exist anymore right?

  Comment: Thanks a lot - love reading those and discovering new things - also the command line corner is great, although I fail to remember most of the commands 😅 (and thanks for featuring NetAlertX🙏)
