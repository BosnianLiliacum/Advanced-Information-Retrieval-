Without this amazing subreddit I wouldn’t have landed the position I did. I recently landed a full stack developer job with a tech stack that was out of my wheelhouse. During my time interview, I was asked what my hobbies were. Of course, I listed home labbing as one of them. This is what sealed the deal for me. Being genuinely enthused by technology is what they were looking for. 

This subreddit has taught me so much (as well as trial and error) about system administration. Because of this subreddit, I have my own personal server running proxmox with 25 LXCs. Every project I find interesting I try out with a new LXC. These containers have really pushed me to learn Ansible for automating various tasks. Guess what my first assignment was. Writing an Ansible playbook to gracefully update a workflow app the company self hosts. 

My experience with my home lab has allowed me to turn my hobby into a career. I honestly couldn’t have done it without the help of all the amazingly experienced people here. Thank you all!
