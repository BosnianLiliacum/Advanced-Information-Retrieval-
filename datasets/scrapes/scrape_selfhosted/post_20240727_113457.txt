Post Content:
I don’t run resource intensive programs on my current homeserver (i think). I would want to spend 200€/$ at max. It should be quiet and energy efficient since my current one costs me ~14€/15$ per month. 

For reference, these are the programs I run:
- Monica
- TubeArchivist
- MeTube
- Nextcloud
- Immich
- BookStack
- Jellyfin
- Audiobookshelf
- Homebox
- Send
- Paperless-ngx
- haven
- Writefreely
- Picsur
- Firefly III
- Mealie

  Comment: Dell/HP/Lenovo all have great SFF/mini models with 8th gen Intel CPUs and up. 

ServeTheHome have tested a huge amount of mini PCs.

  Comment: Odroid has just released their new H4 board which are running on the Intel N97 (or the N305 for the H4-Ultra). Idle power usage is around 2-3W and it shouldn't exceed 20W under full CPU and GPU stress. I'm just about to order the H4+ to replace my 7 year old Intel Pentium-based home server.

  Comment: You could get an 8th gen or newer quad-core non-Atom NUC. An i5 would be plenty for those. If you get the taller version, you'll have space for an m.2 PCIe drive, as well as a 2.5" SATA drive. And Thunderbolt 3, of course, which would allow you to add virtually anything.

  Comment: What I am looking for is 3 or 4 nvme, ecc support and 2 or more 2.5 (or more) ports. SFP+ is ok too.   
internal psu will be great. 

but as far as I can see it’s just a wet dreams :(
