Dear community,

I am trying to selfhost vaultwarden on my server in my local network (only ip-based, no domain). Vaultwarden is running together with nginx proxy manager (npm) in a docker stack. 
I am unable to access vaultwarden using SSL. I created self signed certificates and uploaded them to npm but there is no ssl connection possible. 
Did anyone here manage to run vaultwarden in the constellation described above?

Thanks for any help!

  Comment: Why avoid using domains? It would greatly simplify this.

  Comment: you can use npm to require the SSL cert. Then put these in the custom config.

location / {

proxy\_pass http://\[IP\]:\[port\];

proxy\_set\_header Host $host;

proxy\_set\_header X-Real-IP $remote\_addr;

proxy\_set\_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy\_add\_x\_forwarded\_for;

proxy\_set\_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

  }

  

  location /notifications/hub {

proxy\_pass http://\[IP\]:\[port\];

proxy\_set\_header Upgrade $http\_upgrade;

proxy\_set\_header Connection "upgrade";

  }

  

  location /notifications/hub/negotiate {

proxy\_set\_header Host $host;

proxy\_set\_header X-Real-IP $remote\_addr;

proxy\_set\_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy\_add\_x\_forwarded\_for;

proxy\_set\_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

proxy\_pass http://\[IP\]:\[port\];

  }
