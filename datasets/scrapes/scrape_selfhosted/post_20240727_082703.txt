So I'm brand new here.  I'm looking to self-host my photos.  I found the git-hub document but there are 20 different suggested packages.  There must be one or two that most people use.  Can you recommend?

  
Edit: Just found the html view of the list and saw there were votes.  Immich seems to be the top recommendation, thanks.

  Comment: Heads up for the current kerfuffle about "licensed"/"supporter" install. There's a lot going on with it, but the short version is a poorly labeled way to create a sustainable development lab is still the same as it was ~2months ago, but now you can have a "supporter" sticker on your install.
