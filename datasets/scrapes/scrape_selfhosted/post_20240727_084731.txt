Hi everyone,

I'm currently using a Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM) with an external HDD, primarily running Jellyfin without transcoding. The Pi is directly connected to my Bell Wi-Fi router via Ethernet. While this setup has served me well due to its low resource and power usage, I'm now facing storage limitations and considering an upgrade.

# Current Setup:

* **Device:** Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB RAM)
* **Storage:** External HDD
* **Primary Use:** Jellyfin (no transcoding)
* **Connection:** Ethernet to Bell Wi-Fi router

# Upgrade Considerations:

I have an old gaming laptop (16GB RAM, i7 9th Gen, GTX 1060) that works well with Jellyfin and transcoding, but due to its high power consumption, I primarily use it as a gaming station, turning it on only when needed.

# Goals:

1. **Increase Storage:**
   * Considering a NAS to hold around 5 HDDs (initially using only a few drives, adding more as needed).
   * Looking for a NAS that is power-efficient and budget-friendly (200 CAD max, lower would be appreciated).
2. **Improved Server Performance:**
   * Exploring options for a mini PC, like an Intel NUC, that uses less power but offers good performance.
   * Aim to run multiple Docker containers (30-40) for various self-hosted tools.
   * Current Raspberry Pi setup runs 5-10 containers, but many are unsupported due to the 32-bit OS and limited RAM.
   * Budget for mini PC is 300 CAD max, lower would be appreciated.

# Requirements:

* **NAS:**
   * Holds around 5 HDDs.
   * Low power consumption.
   * Budget-friendly (200 CAD max, lower would be appreciated).
   * Upgradable for future storage expansion.
* **Mini PC:**
   * Low power consumption.
   * Capable of running several Docker containers efficiently.
   * Budget-friendly (300 CAD max, lower would be appreciated).
   * Upgradable for future RAM and storage enhancements.

# Upgrade Plan:

* I plan to buy and upgrade slowly, starting with the NAS and later adding a mini PC if the gaming laptop proves unsuitable due to high power usage.

# Additional Info:

* **Location:** Canada
* **Current Issues with Pi:**
   * Limited storage capacity.
   * Limited by 32-bit OS and low RAM for additional containers.

I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions or advice on budget-friendly NAS options and a suitable mini PC for my needs. Thanks in advance!

  Comment: Look at the WD My Cloud Home or the Synology DiskStation DS220j if you're on a tight budget. 

If you need a good small PC, the Intel NUC or the ASUS VivoMini are both good choices. They can handle extra containers and have a lot of storage space.

  Comment: I can recommend getting a used "prodesk 600 g4" you can get it for under 200€, has a power conumption of 20 watts and I think at least 4 sata connections.
