Post Content:
I am looking for an app that I can use from my phone to scan barcodes and automatically look them up (they are blu-rays).

Essentially want to be able to quickly scan a load of them and generate a big list of what I have scanned and save it for later reference.

I keep finding a lot of inventory software where you generate your OWN barcodes but this is not quite what I want, I want it to immediately look the item up and give me an option to save it.

A bit like eBay does when you list via the app, except self hosted and with a bit of an inventory feature.
