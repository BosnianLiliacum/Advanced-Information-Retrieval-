  Comment: `rm -rf /`  

/s but not really. Have you considered rclone remotes? 

IF you want selective sync / on-demand sync, then what r34p3r suggests will work.

  Comment: TLDR: is there anything like but I can selfhost?

Thanks so much in advanced

Hello, in one drive there is a feature where u can have files in your system path but they're not taking up storage here like   
c:\\test.mp4 is offset to one drive, then when a program is trying to open it it will download it  
to offset a file, u can right click and choose free up space  
I think this is similar to icloud's optimize storage option

  Comment: Nextcloud, Owncloud and seafile all suck. Tried them all, don't work like Google Drive 

Clients on Linux pathetic. Need virtual file support so I don't need to download 10TB to every device
