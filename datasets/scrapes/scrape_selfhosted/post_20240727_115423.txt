Hello, this is a very stupid question but I have a Cisco 880 router/IPS laying around. 

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/880-integrated-services-routers-isr/index.html

Would it be possible to connect my main router to the Cisco router and have a server behind the Cisco 880? Is it viable to protect a server against anything considering its age?
