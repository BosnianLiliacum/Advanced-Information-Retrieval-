Got some problems and don't know where. I tested local distribution speedy and without problems. Tried SWAG and NGINX still same problem. Cloudflare setting still same problem. Cloudflare tunel all without problems. When I load the site in console I got 522 errors that something cannot load because server send 522. When I load site and hit 2 or 3 refresh I am able to work with site but got still some errors. Don't know what to try. Is it possible to have problem in router? I setup only port forward for  reverse proxy. I got Asus router. Or maybe ISP? I have also static IP. And also I am on Unraid server. Thanks for help guys.
