I'm building a headless music player, and I've written a script to automatically upload music files to the directory where moodeaudio pulls from.

Anyway, the new music doesn't show up in the library until I click this star button. Even when going to the M menu and selecting "update library"

I don't see any documentation that tells me what this button is.

Being a headless unit, I want to add into my script, to execute that command for seamless updating in the library.
