I’ve got a smart TV which I had bought a couple of years ago for my parents. 

I don’t use it much. Only my parents use it. 


The issue is, besides Netflix Prime and YouTube, there are no other apps available. 

I have subscriptions to multiple other streaming platforms such as Disney plus,HBO max etc which I would like my parents to have access to as well. 

The tv has access to an App Store however the App Store is pretty outdated with no apps as well.

Which is kinda of a waste

Occasionally I’d purchase movies online as well for them which i transfer to a usb and plug it into the tv for the them to watch. 


Any one has any suggestions where i can host a server locally which has all the apps preloaded, and where i can host purchased movies as well ?



Ps: my parents are very non tech savvy

  Comment: Roku or chromecast?  

I host a jellyfin server to serve the media. Roku has a jellyfin app.

  Comment: Can you sideload apps? If you can u can checkout streamio, cloudstream, jellyfin/emby/plex or any iptv apps. Is there any app there for network share? Or is vlc available? If vlc is there then you can connect a windows/samba share via vlc ro play content.

  Comment: You say you want a local, but your needs say different.  
As u/Historical_Pen_5178 suggests, a Chromecast, Roku, Firestick or similar is what you need.  
This will plug into your TV and turn your "Outdated Smart TV" into an "Old but Updated Smart TV" with all he apps you will ever need.       
If you really want a self hosted TV Platform, then you are looking for Plex or JellyFin.  
You should note that these will not give you al, the Disney Plus, HBO Max, Netflix platforms etc.  
These will create your own streaming app where you provide the content, via either legitimate or nefarious means.

  Comment: I havent tried jellyfin and use Plex for this. The only thing I dont like is how the user is forced to see Plexs free crap first, instead of my library.
