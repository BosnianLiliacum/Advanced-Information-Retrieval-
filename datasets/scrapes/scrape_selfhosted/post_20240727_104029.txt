Hi guys, first post here :)

So basically I just set up my pihole as a recursive DNS and my router correctly goes to the pihole IP, but now most of my prowlarr indexes fail with this error: "Unable to connect to indexer, please check your DNS settings and ensure IPv6 is working or disabled. Resource temporarily unavailable".

On my Pihole DNS settings i've disabled all my "Upstream DNS Servers" and enabled only one custom that goes to [127.0.0.1#5335](http://127.0.0.1#5335) (unbound guide on pihole). 

I haven't found anything that solves my problem, does somebody know how can i solve? 

Thanks!

  Comment: So what is DNS server is pihole forwarding it's requests to for external sites? If you have no upstream DNS servers, you'll only be able to resolve locally configured records.
