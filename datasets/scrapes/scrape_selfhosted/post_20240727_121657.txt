I just upgraded my server hosting rig with some parts from my personal rig. New motherboard, ram, processor. 

Now my server won’t allow me or anyone outside my network to connect BUT I am able to connect via Lan.

Someone please help with this. I’m not to keen on network stuff and could really use the help! Thanks.

  Comment: Im guessing you got a new local IP on the server because you changed the motherboard. So you might have to update your portforward.
