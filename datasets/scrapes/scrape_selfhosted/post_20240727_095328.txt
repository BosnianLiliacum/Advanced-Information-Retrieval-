Not sure whether this is the right subreddit for this question. If not, please lead me to the right one.

I live in an oppressional government and I made a website where I will be writing some oppositional stuff. I also want to take donations from to reader to help and keep the website running. I'm looking at BTCpay for my payments but not sure whether its safe and anonymous. Do anyone one of you know any Safe and Anonymous payment servers or is BTC pay good enough?

  Comment: Don't use BTC, it's easily traceable through the blockchain. Instead,                      use Monero (XMR).

  Comment: You want XMR, not BTC. Also, head over to kycnot.me for services and businesses that don't require kyc and support/facilitate crypto payments (e.g., VPS, VPN, web hosting, sim cards, regular shopping, etc.)
