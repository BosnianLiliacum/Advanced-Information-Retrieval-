Heya, probably the wrong sub, but theres so much HiFi and audio related subs around, that I figured I'd start with a place I can actually relate to.

My dad left me his complete onkyo stereo, that's nearing 50 years of age now. I currently have this sitting in my office hooked up to a surround system from Teufel.

It's complete including tape deck, cd deck, turntables and amp(?), but that's it in terms of inputs. It doesn't even have a native AUX in, so I currently have an AUX to RCA coax adapter dangling off it, that I usually plug my phone or tablet into.

I'm looking for a way to make this thing more flexible. I found some bluetooth to RCA coax thingies, that would work in theory, but I personally hate bluetooth with a passion. pairing/unpairing is a fucking nightmare at the best of times, 2.4ghz band is cluttered with all sorts of garbage nowadays and my house is no exception.

What I do have, is an assortment of arduino nanos/micros/picos, a dozen different rPis and banana Pis of various generations and a wifi 6e mesh.

I already checked the [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted?tab=readme-ov-file#media-streaming---audio-streaming) repo, but am conflicted about the choices there. Primarily because I also stream spotify/deezer/other in addition to the music I have on-prem.

Looking for experience reports, or suggestion of any kind to make this experience a lot smoother.

Cheers

  Comment: Look into the WiiM Pro Airplay receivers. You can cast whatever music you want to them and they pass it onto a rca output

  Comment: I would suggest lyrion music server (formerly known as logitech media server) along with the different player options (squeezelite/jivelite) which can run on different hardware. The server supports playing local music as well as various streaming services.

For a pi I would suggest to run picoreplayer as an os. If you decide to use an esp32 there is the very good software squeezelite-esp32. This software does not only run squeezelite to act as a lyrion music server client but can also receive music directly via bluetooth, airplay and spotify.
