I currently have a AsRock X570 Taichi MB. 8 sata ports, 3 nvme slots, 3 pci-e 

So it seems to be loaded with options I can use to upgrade. Better Ethernet 2.5/10gb and so on.

My issue is currently running a 3800X + 5700xt

My idle is around 100~ even with power savings mode(windows)and p-state = 2 high setting on my board.

I was thinking of grabbing a 5700G w/ on board gpu. No quick sync but still 8c/16t be plenty for my starting home-server/NAS needs(JellyFin/HA/etc)Goal is just to be more power efficient.

Does this sound like good plan? Any suggestions?

Think I'm gonna get a dedicated nas case gotta be a ATX (any suggestions be nice) 

keep meshify C case for next gaming PC upgrade(since no room for HDD drives). Most likely take 5700xt with it for now.

  Comment: Hello, have a couple of sugguestions

How comfortable are you with linux? It will use a lot less resources than windows which should result in lower power consumption 

&gt;My issue is currently running a 3800X + 5700xt 

Does your motherboard support no video signal? You can install linux in headless mode (no GUI) and use just your CPU. 

- You will need to have the GPU in while you install linux, then pull it out after the fact
  - Ensure you enable SSH on the linux install to allow you to connect
- ~~This of course measn no transcoding for jellyfin.~~
  - edit: transcoding works for jellyfin with just a CPU. Confirmed lower in the thread.

Hope that helps
