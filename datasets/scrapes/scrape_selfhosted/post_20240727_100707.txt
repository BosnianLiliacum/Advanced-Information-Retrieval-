Hello,

I have a homelab with photos management, file management etc...

My family are non tech and today I send to them mobileconfig profile generated by an ansible playbook each time we have an update into homelab (last update for pass from WPA2 to WPA3). The future update next year will be huge cuz my homelab has 15 Yo and the root CA will expire.

  
So I think about a lightweight mdm which support VPN/Wi-fi and Root certificate. I want to disable restrictions, tracking, etc...

I have dev account so I generated push certificate for MDM

  
Do you have suggestion please ?
