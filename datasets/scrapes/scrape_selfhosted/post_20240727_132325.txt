  Comment: not to sound mean but why rent a "box" and not know what to do with it? that'd be like me buying a race car and never racing it. lol

look at the awesome links in the sidebar. there's tons of things to try.

the most simplest of things is hosting websites. just nginx pointing to a directory full of html. only you can decide what to do on it.

  Comment: Depends on what you like to do. 

If you want to go down the security rabbithole, then start with Vaultwarden for password saving.

I like tracking my coding time so I self host wakapi as well.

If you're a movies guy, then Jellyfin along with an arr* stack will go a long way. 

You can also throw in Ryot (https://github.com/ignisda/ryot) there if you consume a lot of media or are into fitness.

You can tie all of this up with an uptime monitor. I use UptimeKuma.

2. remember to  patch it regularly , maybe automate it with unattended system patching ?

3. Look at [https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) , maybe something will catch the eye ?

4. If you are using docker .. remember to only expose to localhost .. not to whole public internet (unless you really need to !) example of such [https://pastebin.com/W8B1ccft](https://pastebin.com/W8B1ccft)
