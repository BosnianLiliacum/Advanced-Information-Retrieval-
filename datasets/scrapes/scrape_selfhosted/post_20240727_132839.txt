In this reddit accidentally I found an awesome tool self hosted and open source very beautiful about a tool that can allow query search into a database to retrieve a data visualization very pretty and even export to excel and csv so easily. This tool is Most specialized in select query but you can also import and modify data. 

The more near that I was capable to found out it was ByteBase that looks awesome, and I think do the same bit I know that that's not the software I am looking for.

  Comment: Have you tried looking into Metabase? It's open-source and pretty good for data visualization with query capabilities. If you need to create how-to guides or visual documentation for your team, Guidde has been super helpful for me. Makes everything look so professional!
