The worst part is that it can't be wired, it's an old office building.  
I thought about using ESP32's or Raspberry Pi Zero 2W's (specifically these, as they are the only one's affordable in my country Brasil), so I'm asking for a general guidance, not like a tutorial, but more like ideas, I don't feel like using off the shelf solutions, mostly because of their monthly subscriptions and shady "spy" apps.

The final product should resemble [this](https://www.amazon.com/-/pt/dp/B0CSXVFLTR/ref=sr_1_3?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PyotMQpV-JEel_-LZoKQJIULn4Sygp1pTMGBmi9kqSTqB5hB1iijoHvudcBEZoRijLFMAVq1pPB5o2ZydhyYC3r_tt65E97-JzeiWKd0aZOlRkYpraCzc8E1Fb11QL9fzGlH7sG1QGsEoKV9ui7P_eie7YH_cr6rmi-pWaoqcIM4zJAQsWe6BBDjkO5TG18JmezHpHmgylGWCXqKRdfqSDvEr2QAh5w8pKWw1d_0DZM.ZbAFS5qk_lnQWFpvYIH7t9id3-p7HyhMNvqwUOpxs0I&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Video+Intercom+System&amp;qid=1721228541&amp;sr=8-3) thing, without the phone app, of course.

Is it possible? Am I asking to be spoonfed?

  Comment: You could probably achieve something with home assistant.
Theres plenty of "esp32 camera doorbell with home-assistant Integration" project /tutorials that neatly integrate with phone app notofications etc.

Have not done any of them myself, but sounds like a good place to start

  Comment: There are plenty of good suggestions here. Another alternative if it fits your use case is to get a Reolink wireless doorbell and a tablet with a web browser to view the feed.

  Comment: The rpizero2 will def not be able to handle video and voice, it will barely be able to handle voice 2way, might work better for 1way.
