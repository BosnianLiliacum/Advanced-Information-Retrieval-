  Comment: They aren't asking you to do anything. It's a heads up of a price increase. Are we going to blow this out of proportion too?

  Comment: There are a number of valid criticisms about Namecheap that you can bring up, but they don’t have a huge amount of pricing power - they can subsidize with promos but the folks running the TLDs dictate the prices for the most part.
