I thinks ABS has everything I need, but what am I missing out on by not having Calibre or Calibre-web?

Edit:  
I have a kindle and my library files are all .EPUB  
I use ABS to send to kindle.

  Comment: I use both and I agree Audiobookshelf is amazing but I like to keep audio and e separate.

  Comment: Personally I LOVE the calibre-web sync plugin for kobo, but you specifically said kindle so don't think you will need anything else.

  Comment: I also love AudioBookShelf. Works very well. My only annoyance is that for some reason my install won't identify Chromecast streaming.

  Comment: Here is how I do things...

1. Calibre locally installed on my laptop. The whole docker image thing where there is a VM that I can access through a web browser is just clunky and slow for me. This is how I transfer books to my e-reader too.
2. Syncthing one-way syncs my books library from my laptop to the server
3. Calibre-web has read only access to that same directory. Displays it in a nice web GUI and is useful for sharing books with friends/family or accessing books while out of the house.
