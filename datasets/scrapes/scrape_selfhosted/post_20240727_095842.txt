Hello all! I am looking to root my phone, though I would like to not lose all of my accounts/data. What would be the easiest solution to back everything up, application data and all for easy restore? I was thinking backing everything up to an AVD and restoring it via Google if that was a possibility, though if you guys have any better solutions I am more than happy to hear them! Not exactly sure which subreddit to post on, so apologies in advance if I am in the wrong place.
