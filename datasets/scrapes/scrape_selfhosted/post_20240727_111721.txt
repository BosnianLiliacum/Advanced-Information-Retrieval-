Looking for pro's / con's on both. No discussing about why not to self-host etc.

Just looking for honest reviews for both

  Comment: I use poste for self hosted services to send me emails through an SMTP relay but that's it. It's neat.

  Comment: Mailcow. Quick and easy to setup and use. Good feature base. Makes setting up a secure system relatively trivial.
