Hi everyone! I've just started my selfhosting journey no longer than a month ago, so far I've set up my own Minecraft server and I'm looking to do some more projects to hopefully share with family and friends!

Ideally I would like to use my own custom domain, but I still don't feel confident enough in my knowledge to expose anything to the internet, so I'm using Tailscale for now.  
  
Question is, how safe is this? Could someone potentially still pwn my server? Am I good to continue like this (ofc helping said friends and family to set up their Tailnet stuff)?

  Comment: I think it's more likely that the computers connected to tailscale get compromised instead of your server and the vpn connection. 




There are cases when a zero day bug is found in some library used by tailscale, that could be an issue but not that likely.

Okayish safe, you do rely on a third party for STUN.

Unlikely via Tailscale, more via misconfiguration of your infrastructure.

  Comment: It's really damn secure. Since it's wireguard under the hood nobody can hack it except if you terribly misconfigure it somehow. Furthermore the core server is open source and I trust it even more because Alex from self hosted show works there and I believe if something shady was going on there he would have left.
