Finally after almost 9 months, I have settled ( :-D ) with my setup. I am using Asustor Flashstor 6 with 4x4TB NVME SSDs in RAID 5 setup. I have  a Mikrotik router in front of my NAS where I am running wireguard VPN server to access my NAS when I am not in my home network. These are the two devices that I am using right now. I have learned A LOT during this process and will continue to do so. Thank you to community for all the help :-)

 As part of next step I am planning to buy some low powered mini PCs where I'll tinker with Proxmos/Kubernetes. My goal is to use Asustor only as a NAS, and all the services will be offloaded to dedicated compute unit: Mini PC, raspberry PI or any other low energy demanding compute unit.

  Comment: Do you have cgNAT type of network? I need to connect my home network when I'm outside. Currently using tailscale and it works. 

But since it is essentially wireguard underneath, I wanted to know if one can selfhost that and get by. I don't want to rely on someone else.
