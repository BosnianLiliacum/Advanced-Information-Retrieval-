I have a Supermicro x12stl-if sitting around and I can't get rid of it on eBay etc. I'm selling it for 250€.
I'm planning on building a consumer grade/gaming pc in itx format. Should I use this Supermicro MB or is it a bad idea?

  Comment: would be solid and stable though the Xeon 2300 probably won't be as fast as the Core equivalents but no reason you couldn't game on it.

Guess it would come down to what games you want to play, what GPU you're going to add and the detail level you plan to run at.
