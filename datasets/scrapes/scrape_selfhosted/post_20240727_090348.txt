I want to set up a large mc server using bungeecord. I hope it will have a couple hundred people max. I currently have 24gb ram. How much will I need and how should I split it between servers? (Lobby, skyblock, pvp ect.)

  Comment: For a couple hundred players at minimum I'd recommend 32-48 GB of ram to ensure a smooth player experience. More is always better

  Comment: Do not dedicate too much RAM otherwise the server will suffer performance issues. For vanilla servers, some sources say around two gigabytes is fine.

If the server needs more RAM, then just up the memory by 1GB each until server is stable.
