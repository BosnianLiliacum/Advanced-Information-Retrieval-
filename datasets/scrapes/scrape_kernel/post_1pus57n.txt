I have a 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700H with 12 threads on p-cores and 8 on e-cores.  From time to time, for instance on battery, I'd like to completely shut down the p-cores.  But the system always boot with cpu 0 being a p-core, making that impossible afaict.  Is there a way to ensure that cpu #0 is a e-core?

Comment: As far as I know, the firmware and the underlying CPU decide which core is allowed to be the BSP (the Bootstrap processor i.e the core that starts when power is applied). 

While Linux does allow you to start and stop cores as needed (through the /sys hierarchy), Linux itself cannot change which core and of what type it is, gets to run at startup.

I may be wrong so feel free to correct me.

Comment: Also take into consideration that some P-cores don't have the same instructions as E-cores. (Heavily depends on the generation)

Comment: Worthwhile to test how much the cores consume power with a workload of a set size before going further.

A performance core easily beating the race to powering down might beat an efficiency core having to spend a lot longer doing the same thing.
