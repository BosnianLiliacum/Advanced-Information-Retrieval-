Post Content:
1) make is building all the unnecessary drivers for no reason. How do I fix this?

2) What should I do to optimise kernel for gaming? Currently running a HP Notebook 14 i3 Tiger Lake

I don't have much experience other than compiling a 5.11.x kernel (Successfully failed)

I'm currently on Ubuntu. Not sure if my distro has anything to do with building a kernel

Comment: You need to run "make localmodconfig". It would build only loaded modules.

Comment: On Debian,  i d/l the source, extract it to a folder, cd into that folder, copy my current .config into it, then run 'make [n]/xconfig'.  Window pops up,  i change what i need to change,  etc.  I disable hardware for support that I'll never need on that system , etc.  I save, i exit, i compile, it builds .deb.  i install them, then i reboot.

Ymmv.

You didn't mention your distro, so i was intentionally vague.

Comment: It sounds like you don't need to compile your own kernel.
