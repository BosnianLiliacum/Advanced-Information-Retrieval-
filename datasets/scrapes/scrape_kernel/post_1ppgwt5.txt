I've been diving into kernel building for several weeks, and I'm wondering if it's possible to replace Kbuild with another build system? Like CMake or Meson?

Comment: Any replacement would probably be a hard sell to the kernel community, since every single Linux distribution or platform would need to change how they configure and build kernels.

Not impossible, as the integration of Rust has proven, but the benefits would need to be very substantial to justify the lift.
