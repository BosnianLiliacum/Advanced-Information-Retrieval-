I regrettably signed up to Tailscale with an Apple private relay account, now when i'm trying to sign in to another device (Windows) , it's requesting the password but unfortunately, i have no idea what it is, i also don't see any option anywhere in Tailsscale web interface to reset my password, are there any suggestions to resolve this issue?

  Comment: Tailscale doesn't allow you to sign in with an Email and Password. Instead they require use of an Identity Provider.

If you used "Sign In With Apple"/Hide My Email when creating your account, do the same when trying to login:

1. Choose Sign In With Apple
2. Use Your Apple ID to sign in
3. You should be able to get in

My email address on tailscale is a Private Relay account that I created with Sign in With Apple and I just use my normal AppleID / Password to login.
