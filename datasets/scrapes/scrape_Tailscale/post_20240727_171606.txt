I've got a setup I'm fairly happy with in my Tailscale, but just noticed today that if I ping my exit node, it's going via Relay.

  
My exit node is a gluetun VPN docker container connected to my PIA account, using UK London. The exit node works just fine in day to day use, but when I ping it using `tailscale ping pia-uk` I notice it's always going via the relay - 18ms response so not awful, but wondered is that always going to be the case because it's acting as an exit node and connected to a PIA server? Or have I missed opening a port somewhere? I can `tailscale ping ubuntuvps` (this is my cloud vps) and it goes direct rather than relay, so it doesn't look to be a wider issue.

  
For clarity, when pinging, I'm not using the exit node at that time, just connected to the tailnet.

  Comment: Is the docker container running on the ubuntuvps?
