On iOS or iPadOS, is it possible to subscribe to mullvad VPN with Apple Pay?

With Mullvad app itself, it’s one click via Apple Pay.

  Comment: No, there's no function to pay for any Tailscale subscription or add-on through the iOS (or Android, for that matter) app.

Moreover, all billing is handled in the "Billing" tab under settings within the admin page.
