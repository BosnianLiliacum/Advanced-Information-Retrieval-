  Comment: If you are looking to do a site to site vpn setup with tailscale Opnsense doesnt support the --snat option needed for tailscale to setup for a site to site vpn

There are some work arounds listed here in this post:

https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/5573

But you are on your own if you run into issues. 

Honestly if you have opnsense with both sides having public ip addresses I would just use an ipsec or wireguard to setup the site to site vpn

  Comment: I have a simple openwrt router on both sites and have tailscale installed on both of these devices. 

Devices are able to access any device by either local ip address, or the tailscale assigned IPs, on either network.

  Comment: You don't need to run tailscale on the router even, for this.  You can run it on another device, configure subnet routing, disable snat, add the routes on both sides to your opnsense &amp; done.
