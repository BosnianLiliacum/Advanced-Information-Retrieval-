  Comment: In this situation, your only hope could be a special router on which you can configure TS. Any device connected to it, can access your home network.

I recommend a router from GL-iNET, like [Beryl AX](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt3000/)

You can connect this router to an existing WiFi, LAN; give Internet from a HotSpot or through USB Tethering.

  Comment: I doubt the 100.x.x.x route is going to be advertised to the hotspot -connected device, and the encryption would likely not work that way, so I'm betting it won't work unfortunately. Cool idea though.

  Comment: I don't know if this is limited to the ROM I'm using (JaguarOS on OnePlus 8), but I can share my VPN through hotspot and access my home network through tailscale on a PC. Wireless does not work, but USB tethering does.

There is also some sort of way by using a proxy with hotspot, but I didn't look enough into it.
