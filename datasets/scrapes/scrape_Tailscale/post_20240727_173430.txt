Hi, it's quoted [here in the funnel documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) that the Funnel is available for the [the Personal, Premium, and Enterprise plans](https://tailscale.com/pricing), yet it's mentionned in the [pricing page](https://tailscale.com/pricing) that it is included starting premium. What's the current status?

  Comment: The documentation is correct! And if you scroll down past the features summary to the full comparison on the pricing page, it matches the docs.
