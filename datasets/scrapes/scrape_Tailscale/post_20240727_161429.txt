Hey everyone,

I'm looking into using Tailscale for my network setup and was wondering if anyone has experience or knowledge about its compatibility with the Meta Quest 2. I know Tailscale supports various platforms, but I haven't found clear information regarding its functionality on VR devices like the Quest 2.

Has anyone tried installing or running Tailscale on the Meta Quest 2? If so, how well does it work? Are there any specific steps or considerations to be aware of?

Thanks in advance for any insights!
