I hope it is okay to post this here. I use tailscale for my home devices and I subscribe for the mullvad exit nodes. One of my use cases is to set my exit note to a different country to bypass ads with the youtube application on my iPad. For my iPad, it works flawlessly and I never have troubles. With my wife's iPad, it is terribly inconsistent. She will randomly begin getting ads in a different language (I believe the ads are coming from Belgium while we use the Albanian exit node). I check the ip address and it is most definitely an Albanian IP address. 

I don't understand why it would work flawlessly for me with no hiccups, but work intermittently for my wife. Any thoughts?

  Comment: Not sure why it works for you at all. YouTube has ads everywhere. Might get lucky in a small market, and sometimes there is fewer ads than traffic, but it’s just luck.
