I have been trying to get this working for quite a while now... 

  
I have enabled UPnP (including both NAT-PMP and UPnP)

This does not work and was supposed to be my easy route. I have then also created the static port mappings as mentioned [in this guide](https://tailscale.com/kb/1097/install-opnsense).

I have added randomportmappings as well within my ACL: `{`

	`// Example/default ACLs for unrestricted connections.`



	`"randomizeClientPort": true, // Direct connections` 



	`// Declare static groups of users. Use autogroups for all users or users with a specific role.`

	`// "groups": {`

	`//`  	`"group:example": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example.com"],`

	`// },`



	`// Define the tags which can be applied to devices and by which users.`

	`// "tagOwners": {`

	`//`  	`"tag:example": ["autogroup:admin"],`

	`// },`



	`// Define access control lists for users, groups, autogroups, tags,`

	`// Tailscale IP addresses, and subnet ranges.`

	`"acls": [`

		`// Allow all connections.`

		`// Comment this section out if you want to define specific restrictions.`

		`{"action": "accept", "src": ["*"], "dst": ["*:*"]},`



		`// Allow users in "group:example" to access "tag:example", but only from`

		`// devices that are running macOS and have enabled Tailscale client auto-updating.`

		`// {"action": "accept", "src": ["group:example"], "dst": ["tag:example:*"], "srcPosture":["posture:autoUpdateMac"]},`

	`],`



	`// Define postures that will be applied to all rules without any specific`

	`// srcPosture definition.`

	`// "defaultSrcPosture": [`

	`//      "posture:anyMac",`

	`// ],`



	`// Define device posture rules requiring devices to meet`

	`// certain criteria to access parts of your system.`

	`// "postures": {`

	`//      // Require devices running macOS, a stable Tailscale`

	`//      // version and auto update enabled for Tailscale.`

	`//` 	`"posture:autoUpdateMac": [`

	`//` 	    `"node:os == 'macos'",`

	`//` 	    `"node:tsReleaseTrack == 'stable'",`

	`//` 	    `"node:tsAutoUpdate",`

	`//` 	`],`

	`//      // Require devices running macOS and a stable`

	`//      // Tailscale version.`

	`//` 	`"posture:anyMac": [`

	`//` 	    `"node:os == 'macos'",`

	`//` 	    `"node:tsReleaseTrack == 'stable'",`

	`//` 	`],`

	`// },`



	`// Define users and devices that can use Tailscale SSH.`

	`"ssh": [`

		`// Allow all users to SSH into their own devices in check mode.`

		`// Comment this section out if you want to define specific restrictions.`

		`{`

			`"action": "check",`

			`"src":    ["autogroup:member"],`

			`"dst":    ["autogroup:self"],`

			`"users":  ["autogroup:nonroot", "root"],`

		`},`

	`],`



	`// Test access rules every time they're saved.`

	`// "tests": [`

	`//`  	`{`

	`//`  		`"src": "alice@example.com",`

	`//`  		`"accept": ["tag:example"],`

	`//`  		`"deny": ["100.101.102.103:443"],`

	`//`  	`},`

	`// ],`

`}`





I had a talk with their AI support that wanted me to open up for 41641

Not sure whether this make sense, since I am using `randomizeClientPort`

Really not sure what the next step would be now... Been restarting and following the guides multiple times to see if I missed something...

  
For reference I am trying to ping from and to a laptop on my cell hotspot, to test from outside my network. I have also tested on my work network with the same results. 

  
Does anyone have some advice?

  Comment: Is your opnsense sitting at the very front of the network meaning no ISP modem or CGNAT going on?
