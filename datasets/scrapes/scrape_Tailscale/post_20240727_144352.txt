I configured my EC2 instance to use SSH, and it worked. However, I later discovered that the VPC I created has a NAT using an Elastic IP address, which incurs charges on AWS. Is it necessary to use an Elastic IP for this setup? 



Ideally, I want a zero-cost setup without incurring such expenses.

  Comment: Not if you go IPv6 only.   There is no charge for IPv6 addresses.

If you want IPv4, you have to pay for the Elastic IP address.

Side Note:  If you are using the free t4g.small instance, you will also pay for the disk you attach.  There is no such thing as zero-cost.
