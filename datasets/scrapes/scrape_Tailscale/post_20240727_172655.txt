Total newbie here.

I just installed Tailscale for android on my phone and deployed a Tailscale container on a RPi running OMV behind CG-Nat via docker compose.

I have both machines online when logged into my Tailnet. I can ping successfully each other.

But I think I have not understood the purpose of Tailscale. I want to connect in my case from my phone to my Rpi, and remotely access all my containers running on it (portainer, homeassistant...).

If I type the magicDNS address or IPv4 with port on a browser once on the same Tailnet I get a 404.

Do I have to do something additional in order to get access to the services running on my RPi connected to my Tailnet?

I thought it was as in Wireguard, in which if I connect to it I can see all machines and services running locally as if I were in LAN.

Thanks in advance.

  Comment: If you want to access local resources from where your RPi resides, you need to activate [Subnet-Routing](https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets) for the RPi.

After you start advertising the routes, you'll be able to access those devices. You can also enable the RPi as an [Exit Node](https://tailscale.com/kb/1103/exit-nodes), so you can route all traffic through it like a traditional VPN.
