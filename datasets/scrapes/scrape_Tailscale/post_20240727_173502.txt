Hello,

  
In the admin console, I can't update the container that contains the tailscale.

When I run the updates, I get the error message Failed to update container.

I'm currently using version 1.62 and want to upgrade to 1.70.

Why is this not working, and what should I do to make it so?



Thank you.
