  Comment: Assuming your exit node is your home network, that is secured by your firewall. Setting aside Tailscale, you keep your home network secured by not exposing any services you don't use and by keeping your firewall up to date.

If you are sufficiently savvy (or paranoid), you can deploy a software router such as OPNsense.

  Comment: If I'm using an exit node, I don't care that the IP of that system is exposed. I'm more worried about my local device than my exit node.
