Here's something that could be useful to us but I wonder if it make sense to exist.  Could ACLs also have a "Check" mode like SSH?  I'm thinking of exposing web services and authenticating using Tailscale Auth but like sensitive SSH connections maybe I want the user to have to run a 2FA confirmation before logging in.

  Comment: You do have the option to run your own multifactor service for those sensitive web applications. 

Authelia is one.
