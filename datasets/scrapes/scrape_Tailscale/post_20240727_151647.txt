I was using tailscale and everything was perfect until a power loss happened on the remote side, then the connections is always relayed and the ping is 130ms min.  
what should I do?

Tailscale on both devices is the latest version, also tried to reset the network on both devices, flush DNS, reinstall Tailscale.  
Help!
