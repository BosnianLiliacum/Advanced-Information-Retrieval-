Configured Taildrive yesterday so I can access certain shares of my Unraid Server while traveling. 

Works great on my Windows PC and MacBook. Both on my iPad and iPhone, the Files App keeps looping me back to the top level Folder, once I try to go deeper. 

Like "Tailscale/&lt;Account-name&gt;/&lt;server-name&gt;/&lt;share-name&gt;/Media - and once I enter Media, I am back at "Tailscale", in an infinite loop.

  
Does anybody know what causes this and how to avoid it? Really only happens on iOS/iPad OS. Could not find any other threads here. 

Thank you!

  Comment: I’m curious in doing the same thing - Taildrive and unRAID. Did you find a guide anywhere or just follow the Tailscale docs on setting up the unRAID side?
