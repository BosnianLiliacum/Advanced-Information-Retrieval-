Back story: today early in the mornig 2am the proxmox-mitac node shutdown idk why, and i got
there and rebooted it evrything worked and i left, when i got home i saw it used a relay and i was like wtf!
Afther trying evrything litteraly from manual mapping the 41641 port to the proxmox node to many

Can someone smater please give advise???

  Comment: **The message "Some peers are advertising routes but --accept-routes is false" is highly relevant to the issue of Proxmox tenants not communicating through Tailscale.**

This indicates a configuration mismatch between the Tailscale nodes. For proper routing and communication, the `--accept-routes` flag should typically be set to `true` to allow nodes to accept routes advertised by other peers.

If this flag is set to `false`, it can lead to communication issues between Proxmox tenants, as they might not be able to reach each other through the Tailscale network.

**It's essential to check the Tailscale configuration on all involved nodes to ensure consistent** `--accept-routes` **settings.**

  Comment: you’re very lacking on context but i think what you really want `—port`


—port=N to set the UDP port to listen on for peer-to-peer traffic; 0 means to auto-select.


documentation has a search feature, which i used: https://tailscale.com/kb/1278/tailscaled?q=listen%20port

  Comment: Its not about that, they all try and use the same ingress port on the Nat but only one sucesds as a result only one can establish directly connection, the others use relays wich messes things up as it ads latency!!!

+ proxmox cluster can operate entirley on tailscale subnet such as the case with mine, So it dosent matter!
