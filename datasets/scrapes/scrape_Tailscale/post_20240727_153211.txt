Watched this video with Tailscale and have some questions about the Reverse proxy component.

 https://youtu.be/Vt4PDUXB_fg?si=TE1pEC5tp1H4cCQL

How is this different than pointing tailscale magicdns to nginxproxymanager?  I have SSL cert setup in that from cloudflare, pointed wildcard cname in cloudflare to my nginxproxymanager magicdns name, and then reverse proxy from there.  When I shared my nginxproxymanager tailscale to family they could access my services ok.  

Is there something different caddy is doing?  My setup seems to be working the same, but I am not any network expert.  Is it just that caddy can get the certificate from tailscale (vs having to do this manually with nginxproxymanager)?

I like the ease of the GUI for nginxproxymanager much better as I don't use the CLI enough to troubleshoot as easily when problems do come up.

  Comment: The reverse proxy in this case is interchangeable. Use whichever one you want: NginxProxyManager, Traefik, Caddy, or whatever. 

I use NginxProxyManager here.

  Comment:    Is synology built in reverse proxy the same as well? Currently, i use tailscale with synology provided hostname and configured it with wildcard certificate to access all my services using subdomain.
