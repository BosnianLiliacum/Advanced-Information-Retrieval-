I’ve been reading some negative opinions about LangSmith lately, not that it’s bad, just that it doesn’t always fit once things get real.

Stuff like, gets expensive fast or hard to fit into existing observability stacks

I’ve some alternatives for langsimth like

* Arize Phoenix
* OpenTelemetry setups
* Datadog/ELK
* ZenML
* Mirascope
* HoneyHive
* Helicone

what are you guys using instead?

Comment: We’re in the process of getting Confident AI set up. We tested most of these and it seemed to be the best fit without much code rewriting. Langsmith has been fine for the past year and a half but as our infrastructure grows, it becomes more obvious where langsmith is lacking.

Comment: The fact that this question even exists shows observability tooling for AI wasn't built with developers in mind. In 5 years these tools will be baked into the LLM frameworks themselves. Right now people cobble together open-source solutions. Keep an eye on who's building observability-first AI agents because that market category is about to explode.
