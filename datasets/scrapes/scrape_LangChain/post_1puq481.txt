Hey r/LangChain! 👋

I've been building production LangChain agents for the past year, and one thing that consistently slowed me down was debugging. LangSmith Studio has excellent traces, but I was constantly switching between my terminal and browser to fetch and analyze them.

So I built a Claude Code skill that automates this entire workflow.

# What it does:

Claude can now automatically:

* Fetch recent traces from LangSmith (last N minutes)
* Analyze specific trace by ID
* Detect and categorize errors
* Review tool calls and execution flow
* Check memory operations (LTM)
* Track token usage and costs
* Export debug sessions to files

# Example workflow:

    You: "Debug my agent - what happened in the last 5 minutes?"
    
    Claude: [Automatically runs langsmith-fetch commands]
    
    Found 3 traces:
    - Trace 1: ✅ Success (memento, 2.3s, 1,245 tokens)
    - Trace 2: ❌ Error (cypher, Neo4j timeout at search_nodes)
    - Trace 3: ✅ Success (memento, 1.8s, 892 tokens)
    
    💡 Issue: Trace 2 failed due to Neo4j timeout. Recommend adding retry logic.

# Technical details:

* Uses the `langsmith-fetch` CLI under the hood
* Model-invoked (Claude decides when to use it)
* Works with any LangChain/LangGraph agent
* 4 core debugging workflows built-in
* MIT licensed

# Installation:

    pip install langsmith-fetch
    mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/langsmith-fetch
    curl -o ~/.claude/skills/langsmith-fetch/SKILL.md https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OthmanAdi/langsmith-fetch-skill/main/SKILL.md

**Repo:** [https://github.com/OthmanAdi/langsmith-fetch-skill](https://github.com/OthmanAdi/langsmith-fetch-skill)

This is v0.1.0 - would love feedback from the community! What other debugging workflows would be helpful?

Also just submitted a PR to awesome-claude-skills. Hoping this fills a gap in the Claude Skills ecosystem (currently no observability/debugging skills exist).

Let me know if you run into issues or have suggestions! 🙏
