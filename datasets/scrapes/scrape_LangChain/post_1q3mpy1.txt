Hey all,  
I’m building a web app with **LangGraph** and I’m running my own backend/server.

I’d like to use **LangSmith** `use-stream-react` (and possibly **CopilotKit**) to stream agent/graph updates to the React client, but the docs seem to assume **LangSmith Cloud + AgentServer**.

**Question:**  
Can [use-stream-react](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/use-stream-react) / CopilotKit work with a self-hosted server (no AgentServer / no LangSmith Cloud)?  
If yes, what does my server need to expose (SSE? specific event schema?) so the client hooks/components work?

If not, what’s the recommended way to stream LangGraph events to React in a similar experience?

Thanks!
