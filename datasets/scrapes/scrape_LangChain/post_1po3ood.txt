A Python OSS project called Hindsight just published results claiming 91.4% on LongMemEval, which they position as SOTA for agent memory.

Might this be better than LangMem and a drop-in replacement??



The claim is that most agent failures come from poor memory design rather than model limits, and that a structured memory system works better than prompt stuffing or naive retrieval.

Would be interested to hear how people here judge LongMemEval as a benchmark and whether these gains translate to real agent workloads.
