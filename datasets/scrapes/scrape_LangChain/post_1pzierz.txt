Hello everyone,

I've been building agentic webapps for around a year and a half now. Started with loops, then moved onto langgraph + Assistant UI. I've been using the lang ecosystem since their launch and have seen their evolution.

It's great and easy to build agents, but things got really frustrating once I needed more fine grained control, especially has a hard time building interesting user experiences. I loved the idea of building agents as DAGs, but I really wanted to model UIs in my flow as nodes too. 

Deployment was another nightmare. I am kinda cheap and the per node executed tax seemed ... Well, not great. But hey, the devs gotta eat.


Around six months back, I snapped and started working on an idea i had been throwing around for a while. It's called Cascaide.

Cascaide is a lightweight low level AI orchestration framework written in typescript designed to run anywhere JS/TS can. It is primarily built for web applications. However, you can create headless AI agents and workflows with it in Node.js.

Here are the reasons why you should try it out. We are in the process of opensourcing it(probably Jan first week).

Developer Experience and UX

🍱 Learn Fast – Simple, powerful abstractions you can learn over lunch

🎨 Build UI First – UI and human-in-the-loop support is natural, not an add-on

🏎️ Build Fast – Single codebase (if you choose), no context switching

⏳ Debug Easily – Debugging and time-travel out of the box

🌍 Deploy Anywhere – Deploy like any other application, no caveats

🪶 Stay Light – Tiny bundle size, small enough to actually understand

🔮 UX Possibilities – Enables novel UX patterns beyond chatbots: smart components, AI workflow visualization, and dynamic portalling

🔌 Extensibility – Easily extend for custom capabilities via middleware patterns

🧑‍💻Stack Agnostic – Use with your favorite stack

Costs

Zero orchestration costs in production 

Low TCO - far less moving parts to maintain

Talent pool: enable any web dev to easily transition to AI engineering.

Observability and reliability 


Durability: enterprise grade durability with no new overhead. Resume workflows post server/client crashes easily, or pick up weeks or months later.

Observability and control: full observability out of the box with easy timetravel rollback and forking


I have two production apps running on it and it's working great for us. It's very easy to use with serverless as well.

I would love to talk to devs and get some feedback. We can do an early sneek peek!

Cheers!
