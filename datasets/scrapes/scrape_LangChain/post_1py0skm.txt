You have LangGraph agents, teammate has CrewAI, another team uses custom agents. Getting them to work together sucks.

Proposal: agents coordinate through "relay repos"

* Shared versioned state store
* Agents commit outputs, read inputs from previous commits
* Branch for parallel experimentation
* Policies define triggers (when agent A commits, run agent B)
* MCP for agent interface - framework agnostic

It's like git for agent collaboration instead of code collaboration.

Would this actually help? What's wrong with this model?

Comment: Interesting idea. I think the “git for agents” framing is directionally right, but the pain usually isn’t state storage… it’s semantics + contracts.

What would help:
- Framework-agnostic interfaces (MCP-style)
- Versioned artifacts so runs are reproducible
- Branching for experimentation

Potential pitfalls id see:
- “Shared state” becomes a junk drawer unless outputs are strongly typed
- Triggers quickly turn into a hidden workflow engine (Airflow/Temporal vibes)
- Merge conflicts aren’t like code… agents need domain-specific conflict rules
- Latency + debugging get ugly if everything is commit/poll/trigger

So this works only if it’s really a typed artifact registry + eventing + policies, with git-like versioning as UX… not literally “git as the runtime.”

Otherwise it risks being a clever abstraction that mostly re-implements orchestration, but harder to debug.

Comment: Checkout: [https://github.com/katanemo/plano](https://github.com/katanemo/plano) \- Plano is delivery infrastructure for agents, and promises to be framework-agnostic and offers support for "agents as tools" via MCP. It doesn't have policy-defined orchestration, but has user-trigger orchestration worfklows built in.
