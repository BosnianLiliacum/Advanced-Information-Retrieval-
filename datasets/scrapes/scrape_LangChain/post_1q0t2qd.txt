For anyone building GraphRAG systems who doesn't want to run Neo4j just to store a knowledge graph, I've been working on something that might help.



GraphQLite is an SQLite extension that adds Cypher query support. The idea is that you can store your extracted entities and relationships in a graph structure, then use Cypher to traverse and expand context during retrieval. Combined with sqlite-vec for the vector search component, you get a fully embedded RAG stack in a single database file.



It includes graph algorithms like PageRank and community detection, which are useful for identifying important entities or clustering related concepts. There's an example in the repo using the HotpotQA multi-hop reasoning dataset if you want to see how the pieces fit together.



\`pip install graphqlite\`

Comment: Wow, *exactly* what I’ve been looking for. Use Neo4j on the job, wanted to use something more lightweight for a few personal endeavors. Really appreciate you sharing this.
