Post Content:
Built an open-source **natural language → SQL data agent** using **LangChain + LangGraph**. Under the hood, it builds on LangChain’s community SQLDatabase utility rather than re-inventing database access:

Uses SQLDatabase for schema inspection, execution, and result handling

Extends it with support for Azure AD auth for the Azure native databases + Cosmos DB.

Supported databases:

* PostgreSQL
* Azure SQL / Synapse
* Cosmos DB
* Databricks SQL
* BigQuery

Allows either per-agent datasource configs or a shared, pre-initialized SQLDatabase if you want tighter control over connections and pooling

You ask a question in plain English, and it:

* Uses an **intent detection agent** to route the question to the right datasource
* Generates SQL using schema context + optional few-shot examples
* **Validates SQL safely** with `sqlglot` (blocked functions, enforced LIMITs, dialect-aware)
* Executes the query and turns results back into a natural-language response
* Supports **multi-turn comvos**

It’s designed as a **multi-agent system**:

* One agent for intent routing
* Multiple specialized data agents, each tied to a domain and database

Everything is **YAML-driven** (agents, schemas, prompts, validation rules), and it also exposes an **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) server** so other agents can discover and call it programmatically.
