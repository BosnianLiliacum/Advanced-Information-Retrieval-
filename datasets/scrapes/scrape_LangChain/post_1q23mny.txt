I’ve been working on an agent that passed all its evals and manual tests.

Out of curiosity, I ran it through mutation testing  small changes like:

\- typos

\- formatting changes

\- tone shifts

\- mild prompt injection attempts



It broke. Repeatedly.



Some examples:

\- Agent ignored tool constraints under minor wording changes

\- Safety logic failed when context order changed

\- Agent hallucinated actions it never took before



I built a small open-source tool to automate this kind of testing (Flakestorm).

It generates adversarial mutations and runs them against your agent.



I put together a minimal reproducible example here:

 GitHub repo:  [https://github.com/flakestorm/flakestorm](https://github.com/flakestorm/flakestorm)

Example: [https://github.com/flakestorm/flakestorm/tree/main/examples/langchain\_agent](https://github.com/flakestorm/flakestorm/tree/main/examples/langchain_agent)



You can reproduce the failure locally in \~10 minutes:

\- pip install

\- run one command

\- see the report



This is very early and rough - I’m mostly looking for:

\- feedback on whether this is useful

\- what kinds of failures you’ve seen but couldn’t test for

\- whether mutation testing belongs in agent workflows at all



Not selling anything. Genuinely curious if others hit the same issues.
