Hello everyone,

I am currently learning LangChain and have recently built a simple chatbot. However, I am eager to learn more and explore some of the more advanced concepts. I would appreciate any suggestions on what I should focus on next. For example, I have come across Langraph and other related topics—are these areas worth prioritizing?

I am also interested in understanding what is currently happening in the industry. Are there any exciting projects or trends in LangChain and AI that are worth following right now? As I am new to this field, I would love to get a sense of where the industry is heading.

Additionally, I am not familiar with web development and am primarily focused on AI engineering. Should I consider learning web development as well to build a stronger foundation for the future?

Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated.
