Hey r/LangChain,

I'm excited to share an open-source project generator I've created for building production-ready full-stack AI/LLM applications. It's focused on getting you from idea to deployable app quickly, with all the enterprise-grade features you need for real-world use.

Repo: [https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-fastapi-nextjs-llm-template](https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-fastapi-nextjs-llm-template?referrer=grok.com)  
(Install via pip install fastapi-fullstack, then generate your project with fastapi-fullstack new – interactive CLI for customization)

**Key features:**

* Backend with FastAPI: Async APIs, auth (JWT/OAuth/API keys), databases (PostgreSQL/MongoDB/SQLite), background tasks (Celery/Taskiq/ARQ), rate limiting, webhooks, and a clean repository + service architecture
* Frontend with Next.js 15: React 19, Tailwind, dark mode, i18n, and a built-in chat interface with real-time WebSocket streaming
* Over 20 configurable integrations: Redis caching, admin panels, Sentry/Prometheus monitoring, and more
* Django-style CLI for easy management (user creation, DB migrations, custom commands)
* Built-in AI capabilities via PydanticAI: Type-safe agents with tool calling, streaming responses, conversation persistence, and easy custom tool extensions

Plus, full observability with Logfire – it instruments everything from AI agent runs and LLM calls to database queries and API performance, giving you traces, metrics, and logs in one dashboard.

While it currently uses PydanticAI for the agent layer (which plays super nicely with the Pydantic ecosystem), **LangChain support is coming soon**! We're planning to add optional LangChain integration for chains, agents, and tools – making it even more flexible for those already in the LangChain workflow.

Screenshots, demo GIFs, architecture diagrams, and docs are in the README. It's saved me hours on recent projects, and I'd love to hear how it could fit into your LangChain-based apps.

Feedback welcome, and **contributions are encouraged** – especially if you're interested in helping with the LangChain integration or adding new features. Let's make building LLM apps even easier! 🚀

Thanks!
