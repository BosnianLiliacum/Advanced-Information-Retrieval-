Hey r/LangChain!

I recently discovered LangChain's excellent deepagents project.

That inspired me to build something similar but in the Pydantic-AI ecosystem: **Pydantic-DeepAgents**.

Repo: [https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents](https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents?referrer=grok.com)

It provides comparable "deep agent" capabilities while leveraging Pydantic's strong typing and validation:

* Planning via TodoToolset
* Filesystem operations (FilesystemToolset)
* Subagent delegation (SubAgentToolset)
* Extensible skills system (markdown-defined prompts)
* Multiple backends: in-memory, persistent filesystem, DockerSandbox (for safe/isolated execution), and CompositeBackend
* File uploads for agent processing
* Automatic context summarization for long sessions
* Built-in human-in-the-loop confirmation workflows
* Full streaming support
* Type-safe structured outputs via Pydantic models

Demo app example: [https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents/tree/main/examples/full\_app](https://github.com/vstorm-co/pydantic-deepagents/tree/main/examples/full_app?referrer=grok.com)  
Quick demo video: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgXkbAgUrsKOWpfWdF48cqaxRht-8od/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgXkbAgUrsKOWpfWdF48cqaxRht-8od/view?usp=sharing&amp;referrer=grok.com)

**Key differences/advantages vs. LangChain deepagents:**

* Built on Pydantic-AI instead of LangChain/LangGraph → lighter dependency footprint, native Pydantic integration for robust structured data handling
* Adds a secure DockerSandbox backend (not in LangChain's version)
* Skills system for easy markdown-based custom behaviors
* Explicit file upload handling

If you're in the Pydantic-AI world or want a more minimal/type-strict alternative for production agents, give it a try!

Thanks!
