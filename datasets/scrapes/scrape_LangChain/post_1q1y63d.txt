I recently published my first technical blog where I break down how Large Language Models work under the hood.

The goal was to build a clear mental model of the full generation loop:

* tokenization
* embeddings
* attention
* probabilities
* sampling

I tried to keep it high-level and intuitive, focusing on *how the pieces fit together* rather than implementation details.

I’d genuinely appreciate feedback, especially if you work with LLMs or are learning GenAI and feel the internals are still a bit unclear.
