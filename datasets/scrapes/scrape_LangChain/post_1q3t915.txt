How can I develop an agent skill system on top of LangChain 1.0 toolset to replace tools, and enable the agent to automatically unload and load these tools? How should I design the prompts for this? Can anyone share their approach?

Comment: Hey op, our deepagents repo is built on the 1.0 create_agent() and we have an integrated SkillsMiddleware in the deepagents-cli that supports adding skills [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents/blob/master/libs/deepagents-cli/deepagents_cli/skills/middleware.py)

Hope that’s a good example to get started with and understand how skill building/loading works.  It uses the latest AgentSkills spec.

We also have this [blog](https://blog.langchain.com/using-skills-with-deep-agents/) on Using Skills with DeepAgents that walks through it.  Hope this helps, lmk if there’s any way we can help as you build!

Comment: The key distinction u/cmndr_spanky raised is worth clarifying... skills are higher-order than tools. A tool is a single function with a docstring. A skill bundles prompts, scripts, and context that the agent can discover and execute on demand.

For the mode-switching you're describing, LLMToolSelectorMiddleware is probably what you want. It runs before the main model call and filters down to relevant tools based on query context. Combine that with domain-specific prompt templates in a custom before_model hook and you get something close to skill switching without the multi-agent overhead.

One gotcha: dynamic tool addition after agent creation isn't supported yet. All tools need to be registered upfront, middleware just filters the active set per turn.

Comment: Do you mean a first step does select some most  relevant tools from a listbof (possibly many) available tools and then offers them to the next llm call as tools?

I'd say first is a chain with structured output to return list of selected tools. 

Then just bind those selected tools for the llm to use in next calls/graph
