I m using free version of langsmith n hosting my deep agent with agent server [https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/agent-server#parts-of-a-deployment](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/agent-server#parts-of-a-deployment) everything works but my agent using inmemory for storing checkpoint store, if I configure postgres, created checkpoint tables calling with PostgresSaver.from\_conn\_string(DATABASE\_URL) as checkpointer:

checkpointer.setup()

but when I pass the checkpointer to agent it says, on dev mode langchain doesnt support custom checkpointer. Do I need to buy license for it, which version of license should I buy if I need to.

Comment: I have been attempting it too,
But found out we just have to set environment variables

But as you can see in the issues even that is not working. So I am not at all sure how to proceed.

Comment: One might bypass langgraph dev completely and create fastapis directly and then attempt  from there.
