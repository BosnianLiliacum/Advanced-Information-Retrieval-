Post Content:
We treat LLMs like magic genies that need to be coaxed with 3,000-word prompts, instead of software components that need to be trained.

I wrote a deep dive on why "Prompt Engineering" hits a ceiling of reliability, and why the next phase of agent development is **Data Engineering** (collecting runtime failures to bootstrap fine-tuning).

**The Architecture (The Deliberation Ladder):**

1.  **The Floor (Validity):** Use Steer (open source) to catch errors deterministically (Regex/JSON checks) in real-time.
2.  **The Ceiling (Quality):** Use `steer export` to build a dataset from those failures.
3.  **The Fix:** Fine-tune a small model (GPT-4o-mini) on that data to remove the need for the massive prompt.

Comment: You have identified a critical flaw in agent systems. I look forward to studying steer.
