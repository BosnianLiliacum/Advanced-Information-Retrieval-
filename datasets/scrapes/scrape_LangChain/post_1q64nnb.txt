Hey everyone,

I built \`@neuledge/graph\` because I got tired of the "integration tax" every time I wanted to build a simple AI agent.

Usually, if you want an agent to know the weather or stock prices, you have to:

1. Find a reliable API.
2. Sign up and manage another API key.
3. Write a Zod schema/tool definition.
4. Handle the messy JSON response so the LLM doesn't get confused.

I wanted to turn that into a one-liner. This library provides a unified lookup tool that gives agents structured data in &lt;100ms. It’s built with TypeScript and works out of the box with Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, and OpenAI Agents.

**Status:** It's Apache-2.0. We currently support weather, stocks, and FX.

I’d love to hear what other data sources would be useful for your projects. News? Sports? Crypto? Let me know!

Comment: New to this so not trying to throw shade but what’s the point? Ex if I search any of the examples in Claude I get the same answers. Is the idea that there is more latency with web search and this makes retrieval more efficient / contextual?

Comment: This is really cool, the integration tax is so real (API keys, schema plumbing, then massaging JSON so the model does not derail). Love the &lt;100ms structured lookup angle, that is basically the missing piece for agentic flows that need reliable tools.

Curious, do you have a pattern for caching and tool fallback (like if a provider is down)? I have been collecting notes on agent reliability and tool orchestration here too: https://www.agentixlabs.com/blog/
