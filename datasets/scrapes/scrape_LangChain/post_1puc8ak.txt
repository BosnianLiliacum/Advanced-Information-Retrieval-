Comment: I prefer Pydantic AI agent framework over langchain, just feels more intuitive to me.

Comment: As I understand it, the langchain is for creating agents, and the langraph is for orchestrating those agents. Basically, it's the pimp of the AI ​​world.

Comment: It really depends on what problem you’re trying to solve.



My short take:

If you’re exploring ideas or prototyping quickly → LangChain is fine.

If you care about reliability, control, and production behavior → LangGraph is the better choice.

If you want something opinionated and lightweight → Agno can work, but you’ll hit limits sooner.



I personally recommend LangGraph. Not only for building agents, but because it lets you formalize existing workflows (business rules, approvals, fallbacks) as explicit graphs.

That makes behavior more inspectable, testable, and closer to how real systems already operate.



In practice, agents that work in production often look more like stateful workflows with AI nodes, and LangGraph fits that mental model well.
