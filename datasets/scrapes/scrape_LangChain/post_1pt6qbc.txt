Hi, we are students from University of Maryland. We are inviting individuals with experience using (and preferably designing and building) multi-agent AI systems (MAS) to participate in a research study. The goal of this study is to understand how people conceptualize, design and build multi-agent AI systems in real-world contexts.

If you choose to participate, you will be asked to join a 45–60 minute interview (via Zoom). During the session, we will ask about your experiences with MAS design and use—such as how you define agent roles, handle coordination between agents, and respond to unexpected behaviors.

Eligibility:

18 years or older

Fluent in English

Have prior experience using (and preferably designing and building) multi-agent AI systems

Compensation: You will receive $40 (in Tango gift card) upon completion of the interview.
