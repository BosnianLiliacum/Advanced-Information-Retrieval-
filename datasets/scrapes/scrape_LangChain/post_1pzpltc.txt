Just added a brand new tutorial about Mem0 to my "Agents Towards Production" repo. It addresses the "amnesia" problem in AI, which is the limitation where agents lose valuable context the moment a session ends.

While many developers use standard chat history or basic RAG, Mem0 offers a specific approach by creating a self-improving memory layer. It extracts insights, resolves conflicting information, and evolves as you interact with it.

The tutorial walks through building a Personal AI Research Assistant with a two-phase architecture:

* Vector Memory Foundation: Focusing on storing semantic facts. It covers how the system handles knowledge extraction and conflict resolution, such as updating your preferences when they change.
* Graph Enhancement: Mapping explicit relationships. This allows the agent to understand lineage, like how one research paper influenced another, rather than just finding similar text.

A significant benefit of this approach is efficiency. Instead of stuffing the entire chat history into a context window, the system retrieves only the specific memories relevant to the current query. This helps maintain accuracy and manages token usage effectively.

This foundation helps transform a generic chatbot into a personalized assistant that remembers your interests, research notes, and specific domain connections over time.

Part of the collection of practical guides for building production-ready AI systems.

How are you handling long-term context? Are you relying on raw history, or are you implementing structured memory layers?
