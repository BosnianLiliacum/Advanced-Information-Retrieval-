Comment: I’d suggest creating a tool called pauseActivity that takes N seconds as param/input, with a return of success:true and tell the agent to invoke it when you need and ask the agent to always wait for the return statement before proceeding 

Hope this helps or atleast gives you an idea

Comment: One other way

To introduce a 2-second wait in a LangGraph agent, you can define a custom node function that uses a **sleep function from a standard library** (like Python's `time.sleep()`) and include this node in your graph.

Comment: a bit more context on at what time you want your agent to wait for 2sec may help

Comment: time.sleep(2), no?

Or "wait for 2 seconds" in playbooks

Comment: Literally a one liner in python. You can register a tool with MCP if you want to use LangShit but seriously this is not necessary.
