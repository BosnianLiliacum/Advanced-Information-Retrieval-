Hi,
I’ve just finished a **complete Agentic RAG tutorial + repository** that shows how to build a fully local, end-to-end system.

No APIs, no cloud, no hidden costs.

---

### 💡 What’s inside

The tutorial covers the full pipeline, including the parts most examples skip:

- PDF → Markdown ingestion  
- Hierarchical chunking (parent / child)  
- Hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse)  
- Vector store with **Qdrant**  
- Query rewriting + **human-in-the-loop**  
- Context summarization  
- **Multi-agent map-reduce** with **LangGraph**  
- Local inference with **Ollama**  
- Simple **Gradio** UI

---

### 🎯 Who it’s for

If you want to **understand Agentic RAG by building it**, not just reading theory, this might help.
