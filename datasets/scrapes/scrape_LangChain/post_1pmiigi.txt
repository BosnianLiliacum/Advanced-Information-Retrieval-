Hey everyone,

I've been running CrewAI agents in production and kept hitting two annoying issues:

1. **Temporal Hallucinations:** My agents kept thinking it was 2023 (or random past dates) because of LLM training cutoffs. This broke my scheduling workflows.
2. **Hard Debugging:** I couldn't trace specific execution chains across my logs because agents were running tasks without unique transaction IDs.

Instead of writing custom hacky scripts every time, I decided to fix it in the core.

I just opened **PR #4082** to add two native utility tools:

* `TimeAwarenessTool`: Gives the agent access to the real system time/date.
* `IDGenerationTool`: Generates UUIDs on demand for database tagging.

**Here is the output running locally:**

**PR Link:** [https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/4082](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI/pull/4082)

It’s a small change, but it makes agents much more reliable for real-world tasks. Let me know if you find it useful!

Comment: Why would you do today's date with a tool and not just simply inject it into the system prompt? Genuinely curious.
