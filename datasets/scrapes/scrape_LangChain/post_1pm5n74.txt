I've read some articles on how having a good reranker can improve a RAG system. I see a lot of options available, can anyone recommend the best rerankers open-source preferably?

Comment: If you want to learn more about rerankers, you should definitely read the engineering blogs from ZeroEntropy. They specialize in retrieval systems and recently released zerank-2, which is arguably the best reranker currently available. You can also access it easily via their API.

Comment: Hijacking  slightly for off topic question: is the only point of a re ranker just to have the VDB return a huge number of articles and have an “LLM in the middle” pick a subset based on system prompt guidance ? Assuming the VDB query distances alone aren’t enough to make a decision on what limited set to give the primary agent the articles in needs ? 

If so, why not pick an LLM with a larger context window and just give it more results ? Also how is a 4b re ranker going to fit it all anyways since it has to use its own context limits to sift through all articles returned?

Or if the point of a re ranker is just to shuffle articles based on relevance .. isn’t that literally what the embeddings vectors are for ??

Comment: In Hindsight we use standard ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 and it's pretty fine. It doesn't do any magic, so you need to build some other techniques to rank your results.
