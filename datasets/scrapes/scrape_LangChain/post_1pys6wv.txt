Most agentic tutorials focus on fully autonomous loops, but in production (especially for legal or financial tools), you need a hard stop for manual approval.

I’ve been working on a pattern for LangGraph that handles state persistence specifically for HITL. The goal was to ensure that if an agent suggests a critical database write or an external API call, the state "pauses" and waits for a signed-off manual intervention without losing the conversation context.

This approach uses a checkpointer for state management and a dedicated "Approval" node. It’s significantly more stable than trying to prompt-engineer an agent to "wait for permission."
