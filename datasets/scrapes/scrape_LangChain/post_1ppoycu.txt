Hey everyone,

Web Scraping was one of the most both, time and effort consuming task.The goal was simple: Tell the AI what you want in plain English, and get back a clean CSV. How it works

The app uses **Crawl4AI** for the heavy lifting (crawling) and **LangChain** to coordinate the extraction logic. The "magic" part is the **Dynamic Schema Generation**—it uses an LLM to look at your prompt, figure out the data structure, and build a Pydantic model on the fly to ensure the output is actually structured.

# Core Stack:

**- Frontend:** Streamlit.

**- Orchestration:** LangChain.

**- Crawling:** Crawl4AI.

**- LLM Support:**

\- **Ollama:** For those who want to run everything locally (Llama 3, Mistral).

**- Gemini API:** For high-performance multimodal extraction.

**- OpenRouter:** To swap between basically any top-tier model.

# Current Features:

* Natural language extraction (e.g., "Get all pricing tiers and their included features").
* One-click CSV export.
* Local-first options via Ollama.
* Robust handling of dynamic content.

# I need your help / Suggestions:

This is still in the early stages, and I’d love to get some honest feedback from the community:

1. **Rate Limiting:** How are you guys handling intelligent throttling in AI-based scrapers?
2. **Large Pages:** Currently, very long pages can eat up tokens. I'm looking into better chunking strategies.

Open to all suggestions and feature requests. What’s the one thing that always breaks your scrapers that you’d want an AI to handle?
