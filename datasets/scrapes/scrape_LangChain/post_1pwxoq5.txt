Hey folks,

I'm looking to deepen my skills in **Generative AI and Agentic AI** this year, and I want to invest in quality paid courses rather than relying purely on free resources. I have a solid Python background and some experience with APIs, so I'm not starting from zero.

Comment: When I started learning Agentic AI, my background was mostly in time series analysis with traditional ML. I tried building a job application pipeline on my own, but realized I needed a framework like LangChain or an SDK to make real progress. Following a structured program helped me understand the current landscape and get ready for what’s coming next.

If anyone’s curious, here’s the program I used: [link](https://go.readytensor.ai/cert-983-certifications)
