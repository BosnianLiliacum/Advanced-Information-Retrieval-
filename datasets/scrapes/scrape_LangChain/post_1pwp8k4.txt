Hey everyone,

I built a LangChain tool that lets AI agents search Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) - the rules governing U.S. government contracting.



**Install:**

pip install far-search-tool



**Usage:**

from far\_search import FARSearchTool

from langchain.agents import initialize\_agent, AgentType

from langchain\_openai import ChatOpenAI

tool = FARSearchTool()

agent = initialize\_agent(

tools=\[tool\],

llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),

agent=AgentType.OPENAI\_FUNCTIONS

)

response = agent.run("What are the FAR requirements for small business subcontracting?")



**Features:**

\- Semantic search over 617 FAR clauses

\- Pre-computed embeddings for fast queries

\- Works with any LangChain agent

\- Free tier available, paid tier for production use



**Links:**

\- PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/far-search-tool/](https://pypi.org/project/far-search-tool/)

\- GitHub: [https://github.com/blueskylineassets/far-search-tool](https://github.com/blueskylineassets/far-search-tool)

Useful for anyone building AI tools for government contractors, procurement specialists, or compliance automation.

Happy to answer any questions!
