I’m curious how teams are handling this in real workflows.

When you update a prompt (or chain / agent logic), how do you know you didn’t break behavior, quality, or cost before it hits users?

Do you:

	•	Manually eyeball outputs?

	•	Keep a set of “golden prompts”?

	•	Run any kind of automated checks?

	•	Or mostly find out after deployment?

Genuinely interested in what’s working (or not).

This feels harder than normal code testing.

Comment: Try LangSmith tooling for managing prompts &amp; running experiments. I like it as a piece of my testing and observability stack.

Comment: Not LangChain specific, but [we stopped managing prompts in code](https://finly.ch/engineering-blog/916926-building-ai-native-applications-with-payload-cms-and-the-vercel-ai-sdk). We use PayloadCMS so we can manage prompts through the admin UI, making it easier to let non-technical users help us when it comes to prompt engineering where business logic/domain knowledge is involved. 

We then store all the operations from the initial system message to tool calls and results to the final output in a table we can easily introspect to understand the full process. And by deploying multiple environments (staging, prod) we can safely test until we're happy with new prompts. 

Payload also supports versioning documents so if you want to restore an old prompt that's easy, too.
