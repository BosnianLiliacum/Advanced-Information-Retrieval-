Hey r/LangChain,

For those new or catching up: fastapi-fullstack is an open-source CLI generator (pip install fastapi-fullstack) that creates production-ready full-stack AI/LLM apps with FastAPI backend + optional Next.js 15 frontend. It's designed to skip boilerplate, with features like real-time WebSocket streaming, conversation persistence, custom tools, multi-provider support (OpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter), and observability via LangSmith.

Full changelog: [https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-fastapi-nextjs-llm-template/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/vstorm-co/full-stack-fastapi-nextjs-llm-template/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md?referrer=grok.com)

**Full feature set:**

* Backend: Async FastAPI with layered architecture, auth (JWT/OAuth/API keys), databases (PostgreSQL/MongoDB/SQLite with SQLModel/SQLAlchemy options), background tasks (Celery/Taskiq/ARQ), rate limiting, admin panels, webhooks
* Frontend: React 19, Tailwind, dark mode, i18n, real-time chat UI
* AI: Now supports **LangChain**, **PydanticAI**, and the new **LangGraph** (more below)
* 20+ configurable integrations: Redis, Sentry, Prometheus, Docker, CI/CD, Kubernetes
* Django-style CLI + production Docker with Traefik/Nginx reverse proxy options

**Big news in v0.1.11 (just released):**  
Added **LangGraph as a third AI framework option** alongside LangChain and PydanticAI!

* New --ai-framework langgraph CLI flag (or interactive prompt)
* Implements **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent pattern** with graph-based flow: agent node for LLM decisions, tools node for execution, conditional edges for loops
* Full memory checkpointing for conversation continuity
* WebSocket streaming via astream() with modes for token deltas and node updates (tool calls/results)
* Proper tool result correlation via tool\_call\_id
* Dependencies auto-added: langgraph, langgraph-checkpoint, langchain-core/openai/anthropic

This makes it even easier to build advanced, stateful agents in your full-stack apps – LangGraph's graph architecture shines for complex workflows.

LangChain community – how does LangGraph integration fit your projects? Any features to expand (e.g., more graph nodes)? Contributions welcome! 🚀
