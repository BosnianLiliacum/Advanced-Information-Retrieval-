I'm thinking of frameworks such as n8n and Gumloop, and equivalent prompted agents such as Lindy.ai that generate flow charts from prompts that can then be customized.

Related: do you know of or use any agent builder platforms that create agents directly in code (rather than drag-and-drop interfaces) from natural language prompts? For example, the agent could write code in Langchain, or some other framework.

There have been a few players in this broader space. Curious what folks are using and finding helpful, if anything.

Comment: They exist.  They work. They inform a product concept.  Sometimes run the world.  

What do you think ant webpages. Are they better than blank screens or is a blank screen better?

Comment: Pretty good for some use cases. Too pricey for an agency model. Those agency platforms are capturing your agency’s profits.

Comment: I’ve played with a few of these, and IMO they’re useful but pretty bounded.

Drag-and-drop builders (n8n, Gumloop, Lindy-style prompt → flow) are great for:
- quick experiments / PoCs
- visualizing simple agent flows
- onboarding non-devs

They tend to fall apart once you need real branching logic, reuse, testing, or version control. At that point I usually want to be in code.

What’s been more interesting to me lately is prompt → code rather than prompt → diagram. I’ve seen early tools and templates that take a natural-language spec and scaffold LangChain (or similar) agents directly. Still rough, but promising.

Right now my default is:
- brainstorm flows visually if it helps
- treat code as the source of truth
- use NL prompts to generate scaffolding, not final agents

Curious if anyone’s found a solid workflow that reliably goes from prompt → clean, maintainable agent code.
