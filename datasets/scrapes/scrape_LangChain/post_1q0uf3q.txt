If you are building agents, are you resorting to send traffic to one agent that is responsible for all sub-tasks (via its instructions) and packaging tools intelligently - or are you using a lightweight router to define/test/update sub-agents that can handle user specific tasks.

The former is a simple architecture, but I feel its a large bloated piece of software that's harder to debug. The latter is cleaner and simpler to build (especially packaging tools) but requires a great/robust orchestration/router.

How are you all thinking about this? Would love framework-agnostic approaches because these frameworks add very little value and become an operational nightmare as you push agents to production.

Comment: Start with s single prompt and tools. Grow and split as needed. Use evals to measure this and detect when to change and if you are making progress. Every additional prompt layer is a slower end result, take this into consideration.

Comment: Once you include more than ~8 tools then the llm may not select the right tool. This is the limitation of the llm that should drive the decision between single or multi agent.

Comment: Depends on how long a single agent's context gets. I find that agents handle upto 100k context length quite well these days, so I tend to keep to simple and have everything in one prompt. I only use sub-agents when there's an isolated context-intensive task with little to no follow ups for the sub-agent.
