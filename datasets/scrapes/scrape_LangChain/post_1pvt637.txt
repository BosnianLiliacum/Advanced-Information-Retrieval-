Hey everyone! 👋 I made a **LangChain beginner’s guide playlist** covering the key ideas you need to build real LLM apps from scratch. The playlist walks through core concepts and practical pieces you need to understand how LangChain works.

Finally a simple RAG is created in 4th part will be released soon.....

Note: \*\*\*Beginner guide.
