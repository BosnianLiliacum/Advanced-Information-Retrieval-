Hello everyone,

We're excited to announce a major upgrade to the **Agentic Hierarchy Aware Chunker.** We're discontinuing subscription-based plans and transitioning to an **Enterprise-first offering** designed for maximum security and control.  
After conversations with users, we learned that businesses strongly prefer absolute **privacy** and **on-premise solutions**. They want to avoid vendor lock-in, eliminate data leakage risks, and maintain full control over their infrastructure.  
That's why we're shifting to an enterprise-exclusive model with on-premise deployment and complete source code access—giving you the full flexibility, security, and customization according to your development needs.

Try it yourself in our playground:

# What Our Hierarchy Aware Chunker offers

*  Understands document structure (titles, headings, subheadings, sections).
*  Merges nested subheadings into the right chunk so context flows properly.
*  Preserves multiple levels of hierarchy (e.g., Title → Subtitle→ Section → Subsections).
*  Adds metadata to each chunk (so every chunk knows which section it belongs to).
*  Produces chunks that are context-aware, structured, and retriever-friendly.
* Ideal for legal docs, research papers, contracts, etc.
* It’s Fast and uses LLM inference combined with our optimized parsers.
* Works great for Multi-Level Nesting.
* No preprocessing needed — just paste your raw content or Markdown and you’re are good to go !
* Flexible Switching: Seamlessly integrates with any LangChain-compatible Providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Ollama).

#  Upcoming Features (In-Development)

* Support Long Document Context Chunking Where Context Spans Across Multiple Pages

         Example Output
        --- Chunk 2 --- 
        
        Metadata:
          Title: Magistrates' Courts (Licensing) Rules (Northern Ireland) 1997
          Section Header (1): PART I
          Section Header (1.1): Citation and commencement
        
        Page Content:
        PART I
        
        Citation and commencement 
        1. These Rules may be cited as the Magistrates' Courts (Licensing) Rules (Northern
        Ireland) 1997 and shall come into operation on 20th February 1997.
        
        --- Chunk 3 --- 
        
        Metadata:
          Title: Magistrates' Courts (Licensing) Rules (Northern Ireland) 1997
          Section Header (1): PART I
          Section Header (1.2): Revocation
        
        Page Content:
        Revocation
        2.-(revokes Magistrates' Courts (Licensing) Rules (Northern Ireland) SR (NI)
        1990/211; the Magistrates' Courts (Licensing) (Amendment) Rules (Northern Ireland)
        SR (NI) 1992/542.

You can notice how the headings are preserved and attached to the chunk → the retriever and LLM always know which section/subsection the chunk belongs to.

No more chunk overlaps and spending hours tweaking chunk sizes .

Happy to answer questions here. Thanks for the support and we are excited to see what you build with this.
