I’ve been testing the best AI guardrails tools because our internal support bot kept hallucinating policies. The problem isn't just generating text; it's actively preventing unsafe responses without ruining the user experience.

We started with the standard frameworks often cited by developers:

**Guardrails AI**

This thing is great! It is super robust and provides a lot of ready made validators. But I found the integration complex when scaling across mixed models.

**NVIDIA’s NeMo Guardrails**

It’s nice, because it easily integrates with LangChain, and provides a ready solution for guardrails implementation. Aaaand the documentation is super nice, for once…

[**nexos.ai**](http://nexos.ai)

I eventually shifted testing to [nexos.ai](http://nexos.ai), which handles these checks at the infrastructure layer rather than the code level. It operates as an LLM gateway with built-in sanitization policies. So it’s a little easier for people that don’t work with code on a day-to-day basis. This is ultimately what led us to choosing it for a longer test.

**The results from our 30-day internal test of** [**nexos.ai**](http://nexos.ai)

* Sanitization - we ran 500+ sensitive queries containing mock customer data. The platform’s input sanitization caught PII (like email addresses) automatically before the model even processed the request, which the other tools missed without custom rules .
* Integration Speed - since [nexos.ai](http://nexos.ai) uses an OpenAI-compliant API, we swapped our endpoint in under an hour. We didn't need to rewrite our Python validation logic; the gateway handled the checks natively.
* Cost vs. Safety - we configured a fallback system. If our primary model (e.g. GPT-5)  timed out, the request automatically routed to a fallback model. This reduced our error rate significantly while keeping costs visible on the unified dashboard

It wasn’t flawless. The documentation is thin, and there is no public pricing currently, so you have to jump on a call with a rep - which in our case got us a decent price, luckily. For stabilizing production apps, it removed the headache of manually coding checks for every new prompt.

What’s worked for you? Do you prefer external guardrails or custom setups?

Comment: Agree with this. Framework guardrails are powerful, but they get hard to scale and maintain pretty quickly. Gateway-style guardrails feel more production-ready, especially with built-in PII filtering and model fallback. We usually end up with a hybrid setup , a gateway for baseline safety, and custom checks only where product logic really needs it.
