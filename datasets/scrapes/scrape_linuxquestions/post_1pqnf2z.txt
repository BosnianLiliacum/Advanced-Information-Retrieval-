Comment: I assume you're referring to the **Intel Celeron N4000 CPU**, running on a laptop.

High demanding tasks like 3D rendering, Winboat (runs in a VM) and gaming are a no-no for this system.
It will probably struggle just browsing with Chrome.

Yes, Linux runs basically on anything, if you don't have any experience with Linux, it's better to start off now. Windows and "easy" out-of-the-box Linux distros will run very poorly. I suggest installing any highly customizable distribution without a desktop enviroment (like Arch), and then download openbox, which is a very light window opener, so you can run browsers and any other normal apps.

You're better off running Java Minecraft with optimization mods, yes truly Bedrock was optimized over the years too, but for me it's an obvious choice.

You can run a Java Minecraft server with a plugin so players with Bedrock can join, if playing on a server with friends is what you're looking for.

Comment: no idea wth winboat is, but you can probably run blender on that with nothing else running in the background. You won't have a good experience trying to render on it, or work on complex scenes. 64-bit modern web browser may struggle on complex sites too because of the low RAM.

Comment: Certainly you can install and boot Linux. But with a CPU like that, you might find that performance is very poor regardless of what OS you're using.
