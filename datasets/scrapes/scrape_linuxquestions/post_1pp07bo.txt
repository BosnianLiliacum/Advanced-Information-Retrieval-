I've switched to Linux at work, and part of my job includes creating documentation and guides. Does anybody have recommendations for \[GUI\] programs that allow basic image editing? In particular, the two functions I use are cropping, and circling parts of the image. On Windows, I just open old-school Paint.exe which is pretty much the same that I used on Win 95, and in Linux, the closest I've found is mtPaint. However, mtPaint seems to only do lines that are a single pixel wide.

I'm using Linux Mint (Debian Edition), and there are some tools that let me view and crop the image (pretty much everything supports cropping), but if I want to circle a part of an image, the next best options seem to be GIMP and Krita, and that's way overkill for what I need (and they are so heavy weight compared to something like mtPaint).

I don't want to reinvent the wheel if I don't have to, but if there are no better alternatives, I can try to do something in Python.

Thanks for any help! I'm not a Linux pro, but I've used Debian in my non-work life for 10 years or so I can handle a little mucking about.

**edit**: gwenview was easy to install and easy enough to use (I'm glad for the keyboard shortcuts!), so that's what I think I'm going with. Thanks so much for all the suggestions! I have a bunch of docs to make over the next few months, and this'll help a bunch.

Comment: Pinta is my favorite "in between" image editor.  its not trying to be a powerhouse, but its more capable then things like gThumb.

Comment: If you use KDE frontend everything you need is a basic feature of the screenshot tool. You simply press 'print' and do your edits in the preview of your clipboard before you decide to save it as a file or paste it somewhere. 


Apparently there is a package of it for mint as well, called kde-spectacle

Comment: I like Pinta, but I really wish there was something more like IrfanView on Linux.

Comment: It's actually a miracle that there's no standard mspaint clone.  I've never found one for Mac or Linux.

I'd just go with Gimp and use a subset of the features.
