Hello. I bought an 2TB HDD for my PC. After installing it I was met with a choice between different filesystems to use on a drive. At first I decided to use FAT32 because I had the same file system on my NVME drive. After some thought I decided to check if my choice was correct and learned that FAT32 is used mostly for solid state drives and also outdated. I decided to read what filesystem is more appropriate for HDD and next thing I decided to try was ext4. Unfortunately ext4 uses 5% of my drive for root privileges which I think is too much for 2TB of storage. Next thing I was going to try was Btrfs but there's also ZFS and others.

Which filesystem is a good choice for an HDD drive that doesn't require 100gb of my storage to function?

Comment: I‘d recommend EXT4 for your use-case. As for the 5% it reserves for root, you can disable that. I made a blogpost about it too lol https://pixelbrush.neocities.org/entries/2025/05/30.html

TL;DR:

`sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/partition`

(Replace `/dev/partition` with the relevant ext4 partition, you can find it via `lsblk`)

Comment: &gt;FAT32 is used mostly for solid state drives

Uh, no. SSDs can use any filesystem HDDs can. And it's also not really outdated? It's still commonly in use, but only for applications where maximal compatiblity across devices is required. E.g. a USB flash drive might be FAT32. Your EFI bootloader partition is definitely FAT32, because that's guaranteed to be supported by all UEFI motherboards.

Also, pretty much all filesystems will take some overhead. Linux filesystems take it for Unix features like permissions. ext4 is actually lean, because it's a comparatively simpler filesystem than the other ones you listed.

Comment: based on your post, ext4 would be the best option for you. Information about 5% quota is false, in worst case you can disable it any time

Comment: ext4 is a good choice. It is lean, fast, and above all robust.
