Preferably one with an advanced text search option that provides me a list of all matches instead of having through them one at a time.

Comment: You might take a look at Evince (default Gnome PDF reader) or Okular (default KDE Plasma PDF reader).  Both have become "standards".

Lots of other options are available.  You might find [Best PDF Reader for Linux](https://linuxconfig.org/best-pdf-reader-for-linux) a useful resource.

My best and good luck.

Comment: I'm not really into PDF world, I Just use at base level to study. I use on arch (and on win on my other PC) Okular. Has some nice features, give it a try.

Comment: There are a million PDF readers. Search your package manager. I'm partial to evince.

Comment: You must distinguish between PDFs created from text and those simply containing images. In the second case, searching is impossible anyway.

Comment: I know exactly the feature you are looking for, I used it a lot.

I was going to chime in here with "Just use Adobe Acrobat for Linux" which I always found stable and capable. But I googled first and found out that Acrobat no longer supports that. That is a bummer since it was so good.

Maybe someone knows of a site that still has the download. (it was not installed as a package, but rather it was a install script)
