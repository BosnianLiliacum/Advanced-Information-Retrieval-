So I have an old laptop with an hdd which has around 256 gb and I want to use it for storing. It has Bodhi Linux on it, and my normal laptop is Windows 11. I want to use the Linux laptop as a storage device and plug it into my Windows laptop. I do not want to buy an enclosure, and it would be best if i didnt need to download any third-party app on my Windows laptop. Thanks!

Comment:  &gt; I want to use the Linux laptop as a storage device and **plug it into** my Windows laptop. 

You mean you want to do a USB-to-USB cable connection? 

otherwise, just setup network (samba) shares.

Comment: You network windows and Linux together. Transfer files back and forth as you like
