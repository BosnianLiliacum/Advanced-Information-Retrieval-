Comment: Same as the last 20yrs.

Noting old shit the person was going to throw away and helping them repurpose it.

The kiddies that I helped put some Mom or Dads old Dell laptops 20yrs ago when I worked as a Dell field tech...

Microsoft should be paying me royalties for the number of kids I put onto Minecraft over the years.   

  
More for the number of old lappies I helped them setup as servers for their mates to join and play on.

  
Kids be kids..

Comment: I stopped caring about adobe products and league of legends - and fully embraced the Linux ecosystem. Even at my job I had the option to completely switch to Linux. It feels really good to just accept the losses and enjoy the freedom.
