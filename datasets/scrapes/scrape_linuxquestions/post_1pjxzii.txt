Just switched to linux for the past couple of months. For context, I've already used a couple of the big name ones in the past on windows but I don't have any idea what vpn is good to use on linux.

I'm mostly looking for something that's reliable, has decent speeds for streaming, and doesn't require me to be a command line wizard to get connected. Privacy is also important ofc.

I've seen vpn reviews for linux versions but they're all over the place. Some say they're great, others say they suck.

Just wanted to ask fellow linux users firsthand instead. What vpn are you actually happy with? How's the setup process? And have you noticed any weird performance issues or connection drops?

Comment: I switched to Linux recently too and had the same concerns. ProtonVPN has been reliable for me, decent speeds for streaming, and the Linux app was straightforward to set up without living in the terminal. Details here: [https://protonvpn.com/redditvpn](https://protonvpn.com/redditvpn)

Comment: Mullvad. They got raided by the cops to seize their logs, but they got nothing because there were no logs to seize. If that's not an endorsement Idk what is.

Comment: Personal VIew mix with professional testing (my business does audits)

**Top ones I would personally use on Linux**

* Mullvad - Best combination of true privacy, service, and cost
* Mozilla (uses Mullvad servers)
* Proton would be higher if it had feature parity with the Windows client.

**Ones I would personally avoid**

* PIA (Private Internet Access): Ties to Government (Israel) 
* NordVPN: Had a security breach that could cause major issues and didn't notify users until it was leaked online. As someone in the business, their explanation was BS. They are also linked to Tesonet who is a data mining/aggregation company. They say they are opperated separated, but I question that, and since there are better alternatives, not worth the risk.

Comment: A couple of weeks ago, I was also looking for the best VPN for Linux. I have explored different subreddits and lastly stumbled upon this [**detailed comparison of different VPNs**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR1NYwdWrRvNISlCZib1L1U5oEqe42tAljThUrlhp7RHGujAJXGmueaVb23G8SRk48X9sJBIJLbtlAr/pubhtml) in one place. I have checked out and compared all VPNs and it makes it pretty easy for me to make my decision. It has a comparison based on features, pricing, speed, streaming, support and much more.

I hope this will help you too in finalising the best VPN for you too.

Comment: I won't use anything that doesn't let me use plain old wireguard, I don't trust or want their first-party apps and I've found Wireguard as a protocol considerably more reliable/robust especially on mobile connections.

Most of the time, I use trailofbits/algo on github's scripts to deploy my own tiny wireguard VPN node to one of the smaller cloud providers, which includes ad-blocking dns as a setting.

If I need something really temporary in a specific region, I'll use Proton VPN as they offer plain wireguard configs and not just their app/ovpn.
