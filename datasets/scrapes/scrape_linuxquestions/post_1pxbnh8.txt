I've been wanting to switch to linux on my main laptop but I do need to draw, I currently use photoshop but I know that's not possible on Linux so I'm probably gonna switch. Are there any apps for linux that are actually good and somewhat professional?

Comment: Krita is a drawing focused image editor, very mature and feature packed, might be what you need.

Comment: +1 for krita, its THE go to for an open source drawing app, and rivals photoshop for sure for drawing.

Comment: People use Photoshop for a lot of things so it's so the best replacement isn't necessarily the same for everybody.

If what you mean by drawing app is that you want to be able to paint digitally, then Krita is good and somewhat professional.

Comment: Krita, Pinta, RapidRaw, RawTherapee, DarkTable, Blender, Inkscape and also Gimp. Shotwell, Pix, gwenView for pic management.

Comment: Literally just krita. Other drawing apps are useless or too simple. There is also a pencil tool in blender3d but it’s working very much differently compared to programs like krita, csp, photoshop, and alike.
