I know about sending jobs into the background and job control.

What I'm wanting is some way to execute a single command, launch multiple processes simultaneously... but instead of them going into the background, the terminal maybe splits into 4 panes and I can watch all 4 jobs output that way as they're running.

The jobs that I'm wanting to run would be nice to see their output as it's running.  I am sure that I could put something together with tailing the logs and updating every few seconds, but I was hoping there is some already existing solution to this.

Comment: You’re describing tmux

Here’s a short description of tmux:

It lets you create sessions, windows (tabs basically) and panes (split screens)

You can run commands on them, detach, close terminal, open terminal again, re attach and all your commands are running with all their logs.

It’s one of the best tools I was putting off for years until I tried it and realized it’s the core tool that lets me use terminal in a comfortable way

Comment: I've never really used the feature but GNU Screen can do this by splitting the terminal window

Comment: tmux, screen, zellij, twin, byobu,Dvtm   and I seem to recall at least 2 others who names I cant remember...  

all are basically terminal 'multiplexors' that let you do similar things as you mention.

Comment: You can try the "parallel" command, however this is in fact one foreground process (parallel) managing multiple background processes. It's a question of definition whether you call these processes "foreground" or not
