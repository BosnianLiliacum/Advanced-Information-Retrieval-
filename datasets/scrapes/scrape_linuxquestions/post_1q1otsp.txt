The two most well-known NTFS drivers on Linux are `ntfs-3g` (FUSE driver, used for over a decade) and `ntfs3` (kernel driver since 2021, replaced read-only `ntfs` kernel driver).

[A comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1obgrxx/ntfsplus_announced_a_new_linux_driver_for_ntfs/nkh80mn/) by /u/Joe-Cool on /r/linux_gaming:

&gt; I usually always remember to `-t ntfs-3g` in my mount parameters. The Tuxera userspace driver is a lot more stable, imho.
&gt;
&gt; Something about it bothered Linus and he merged ntfs3 into the kernel instead. I can't really remember what is was though.

This got me curious and I decided to research it a bit, but couldn't find a definitive answer. Does any of you know what bothered Torvalds about ntfs-3g? 

Was it something licensing/bureaucracy-related or actually a technical reason?

Comment: That recollection has to be completely wrong for one simple reason, ntfs-3g is a userspace driver. It doesn't go near the kernel. Linus would never have "merged ntfs3 into the kernel instead" because ntfs-3g would never be part of the kernel.

Paragon submitted NTFS3 and it was accepted into the kernel. It's that simple.

Just by merging something in the kernel, there's no implication that Torvalds was bothered about the userland alternatives.

Comment: Nothing, why can't we have both?

ntfs3 was accepted because there was simply not a driver for NTFS available at the time.  
ntfs-3g is a FUSE driver, not the same.

Comment: From my experience, ntfs3 reads much faster than ntfs-3g (ntfs-3g sometimes is in the single-digit MB/s), and it can show birth times (`stat` command) thanks to the statx syscall, probably owing to ntfs-3g running as FUSE, not kernel driver.

But sometimes when trying to make changes, ntfs3 gives me a "permission denied" error even with correct `uid` and `gid` mount options. ntfs-3g does not have this glitch. If correctly mounted, it just does what I ask it to.
