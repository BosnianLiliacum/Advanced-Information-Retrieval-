I've been thinking about making the switch, instead of upgrading to W11. But I use some specific software for illustrative work (Clip Studio, PureRef, ACDSee, DesignDoll etc...) I also use an older Cintiq and a VR headset occasionally. 

Just wondering if I'm going to be dealing with more pain and frustration or if things work pretty smoothly now.

Comment: VR Headsets shouldnt be a problem from my experience (I got my BSB working just fine on arch, and documentation goes all the way to even [older Oculus models](https://lvra.gitlab.io/docs/hardware/)) and hardware, but specific software tools wills be more complicated; when changing OS there is always goign to  a time of trying to find alternatives, Linux simply is NOT a drop in replacement.

Comment: Only one of those apps has a native Linux version, so you're going to be dealing with Windows emulation for the rest...

Comment: You likely are going to have to learn some new software. Please google them. I am betting grease pencil in Blender + some addons will get you what you use in Clip Studio. You can always ask Google Gemini to try generate it for you. I do not know what the difference is for PureRef and ACDSee. DesignDoll you can probably script that functionality yourself in Blender. I have never used any of these pieces of software before so just guessing basing what I read on the front page.

You can always try to open steam, add the installer as a nonsteam app, use proton to install it, then change the steam entry to the main .exe to see if it runs.

Keep in mind; these are obscure pieces of proprietary software. They could be bought out the next day by a megacorp that tells you to go learn their suite. Or the firm stops selling it for whatever reason. Blender on the other hand is GPL open source backed by a strong community. It won't be shut down by a megacorp and it won't phone home to check if you have a license.

Watcom Cintiq tablets should be fine. What VR headset? Not sure about the occulus but the Steam Frame coming out should be fine.
