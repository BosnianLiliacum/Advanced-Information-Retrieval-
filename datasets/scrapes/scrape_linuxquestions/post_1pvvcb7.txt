htop gives a cleaner, interactive view of processes compared to top.



Do you use it regularly, or do you prefer something else?

Comment: I prefer btop most of the time. I like the network, I/O and per core display. Just a bit more modern than htop. 

Haven’t played with atop yet.

Comment: I work on mostly ubuntu servers (non-root) and most of them have htop installed by default. so it convenient to use since it always installed.

Comment: I used to use htop. That was the first thing installed. Once I discovered btop, I realized that it gave better memory readings and network activity.

I think I should learn the top keybindings, though.

Comment: Sometimes, but mostly just top since it’s ingrained in memory.
