We all start somewhere.



Mine was breaking permissions and not understanding why sudo didn’t fix it.



What was your first Linux mistake, and what did it teach you?

Comment: Oh goos god, I have two, and I am older:

When I was sixteen, back when Linux was like four or five years old, I downloaded Slackware over a 56k modem. And it took me over a month to get it downloaded.

This was before usb drives and even cd burners.

So everything was downloaded to the C:\ drive. I followed the directions precisely:

Create a linux boot floppy, boot off of it, delete the FAT32 partition, and boot off your installation media. Um……. 

Installation media not found.

Shit, mom, I will get your AIM contacts back (they weren’t stored on a server; I had to scour the drive by hand! The files no longer had functional names. )

I don’t know how many files I had to have gone through. There was no directories, the file system was completely non-existent. I was opening files like you would open them in a text editor. 

I found it, though. That was an ultra mega bitch, but I found the file and got her contacts back, two years later.

Bear in mind, I hadn’t even installed windows before. I had no fucking idea what a partition was.

I was following the readme, which obviously assumed I was using some sort of external media.

The other was when I learned that mv is recursive:

I was updating a server, and I had put all the installation files for the upgrade to / (all .rpm, this was like FC4). Got everything installed and I thought, “I’m going to be safe and smart and mkdir /upgrade and mv /* /upgrade”

On a production server while I am running as root. This was on a production server. Yeah, that moved everything. Stressful day. It didn’t disrupt the server, and thank God it didn’t need a reboot until I could get to it after midnight and I was able to move it back into place. 

Hands down, the two shittiest Linux mistakes I have made. Both were over twenty years ago.

mv as root is dangerous, kiddos.

Comment: Planned to dual boot but wiped the entire disk instead. All data vanished, and I realized it after hours of playing around.

Comment: Today I was about to delete my whole computer while installing linux mint Mate for the 1st time. But thankfully I have the habit of reading before not trusting YouTuber saying "you have to just click next a bunch of times" Still haven't understood "something else" fully. Anyone willing to answer my stupid questions?

Comment: Long ago. UNIX. I did `rm -rf  /` on a development box when I meant `rm -rf *`. Ooopsie.

The thing kept working for a few minutes, oddly enough.
