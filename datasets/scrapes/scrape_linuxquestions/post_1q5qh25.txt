I wonder why there are a lot of questions here about that command and what it does? It simply deletes all the files including your personal data and corrupts the system requiring a reinstall. You lose all your data as well. I also don’t get why there are people that tell others to run this command even as a joke? I won’t give the command but most of you should have understood what command I am talking about.

Comment: Because if you memeify it and point it out as dangerous new users get the meme and understand what it does should they ever need to use it.

Kind of like how Reddit automatically covers your password: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Comment: Windows had the same dynamic back in the 2000s. You were told Windows had a hidden server, the file was `hidserv.dll` and you should delete it.

Deleting it put you in a world of hurt because:

&gt;hidserv.dll is a core Microsoft Windows system file for the Human Interface Device Service, enabling your computer to recognize and use devices like keyboards, mice, touchpads, and multimedia hotkeys

So this trickery isn't just Linux.

Comment: It’s a meme because it succinctly demonstrates the power a user has over their system in Linux and the risk that poses, while at the same time acting as a parable about trusting strangers on the internet

Comment: So it's an old one. Arguably older than the name "meme"
The mistake originated more from rm -rf ./* Where you delete everything in your current directory down. As root. (Before sudo it was more common to log in as root or run su). But forgot you'd moved to / at some point. Or typo'd / while thinking what you were trying to delete.

The ultimate point is UNIX/Linux gives you full control. No hand rails. To do what you want. 
Including completely fuck up your system.
