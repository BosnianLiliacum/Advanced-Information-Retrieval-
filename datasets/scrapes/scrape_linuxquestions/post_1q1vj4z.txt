New year reflection question.

Could be a technical mistake, an operational habit, or something you learned the hard way.

Not about blame -  just lessons worth remembering.

Comment: Think you don't need backups. Think you'll set up backups later. Think you'll remember to always perform manual backups because you remembered today. Think a redundant RAID array is a replacement for backups.

Do your backups people. Go now and think of everything that will make life hard if you lose or can be lost forever if gone now and setup a backup for it. Your family photos. Your school projects. If you're into tinkering and customising every aspect of your system, backup your /etc, /home, perhaps also your package lists or package manager state (apt/dpkg, pacman, etc..).

If you have backups, check their status.

Comment: Spending too much time tinkering as soon as installing the OS (adding extensions,customizing etc.) and missing the purity of the "DEFAULT". (Debian user coming from Fedora (both Gnome). Top 2 for me.)

Comment: Fooling around with rolling distros or even Fedora. No more distro hopping: Mint's got all I need and it's super stable.
