New year reflection question.

Not about distros or tools - more about habits.

Could be troubleshooting approach, documentation, scripting, security, or anything else.

Curious:  what others are focusing on.

Comment: My habit is pretending I can accomplish everything I want in the same point and click fashion as windows. The terminal is there and there is a point where there's no avoiding it if actually want to use your OS the way that you want. So my resolution is to actually learn the freaking thing properly.

Comment: Focusing on learning more about underlying configuration so I'm able to diagnose and repair minor issues. With the hopes of higher uptime and less need to reinstall. 

And maintaining proper backups.

Comment: Always have a 'last' as part of your login shell to see who logged in last..

Always have a smtp set up to send you security alerts.

Never go a week without an upgrade of your package s.

I do this, you should too unless you already are.

Comment: "Stop wasting so much time on reddit"  

:) 

Whats funny is its truely something I plan on doing.

Currently unsubscribing from most subs i rarely visit, or that have any value for me any longer.  
I dont NEED to be subscribed to every Distro specific sub, for all distros i ever used, but no longer use.
