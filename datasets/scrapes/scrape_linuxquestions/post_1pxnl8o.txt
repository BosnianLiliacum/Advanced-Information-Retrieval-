Depending on the issue, Ubuntu forums/support and Mint forums/support might be useful resources.

You might also do an old-fashioned, targeted internet search with a reasonable description of the issue, and then see what turns up.  My experience is that a few sites (Techmint, ITS FOSS, XDA, and so on) show up consistently and often have decent answers.  The beauty of an old-fashioned internet search is that you can get context and alternatives, rather than just AI instructions.

You might also look into the Arch Wiki.  I've found that the Wiki, although about a completely different distribution, often provides in-depth context and background.

My best and good luck.

Comment: You can't give up on web searches.  It's always been full of trash.

There's no single site that's going to answer the questions you'll have exactly.

You'll just have to bone your system a bunch of times.  With enough experience, you'll learn to realize what's slop and what isn't.
