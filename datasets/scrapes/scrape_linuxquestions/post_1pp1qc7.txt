I have always been very annoyed by slightest judder/lag in graphics. When I see windows open I want them to smoothly open up and not load mostly, then stall and finally do the last bit.

I have seen this improvement on Raspberry Pi 5, Intel 7th gen i3 laptop, Intel Haswell i3 and a Ryzen 5 (less since it is a lot faster than the others).

I am curious, what in kernel 6.18 did this wonderful thing to my computers?

Comment: Sheaves? It was a major update. It helps with memory allocation in multi core processors. Theoretically, it could account for what you're seeing. But maybe I'm retarded. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can tell us.
