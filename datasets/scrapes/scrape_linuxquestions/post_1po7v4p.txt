I know there's htop and btop, but I want something that also looks good. Should be also lightweight.

SOLVED. Okay, you can stop making suggestions, I've decided on lxtask.

Comment: There are many options out there but if they need to fit the good looking **and** lightweight classification then i'm afraid there's nothing.

The classic desktop environments have fairly heavy weight task manager. Especially Plasma.

You might want to look at task managers from the alternative desktop environments (cosmic, xfce, ...). [Mission Center](https://gitlab.com/mission-center-devs/mission-center) is probably the only one that gives a very familiar windows feel if you liked that. Don't know about it's performance though.

Comment: Mission Center works good for me when I want a gui task manager, however a terminal option is my first port of call usually.

Unfortunately, you can only choose one of these. :-/
