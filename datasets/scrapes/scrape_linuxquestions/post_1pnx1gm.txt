What made you decide to switch to Linux, whether it be a single moment or event, or it be a series of events, or rollout that rubbed you the wrong way? I wanna know. Go on about it as long as you can.

Edit: thank you for all your responses.

Comment: I have a feeling I'm not unique, but when my computer couldn't update to Windows 11 because it was missing a TPM chip. That was the final straw. I still have a computer that runs windows for games. My laptop and my older desktops were all switched to some form of Linux Mint. The second all the games I play are compatible with Linux I will make the full switch. I dream of this day lol

Comment: I got my first computer at age 8 or so (Atari 800XL). I started working in IT at about 15 years old (1994ish). I got free copies of every MS home OS from that point forward. It was the massive bloat (among other things) between Windows 95 and Windows 7 that made me (finally) switch full time. 

Yes, I understand that Win7 got better. A lot better, honestly. I use Windows every day for work. But at the start? Win7 was a hot mess and slow af. 

To be fair, though, my *beginning* was when I installed Slack for the first time in 95 or so. Though that install didn't last long. OS/2 was way better. 😂😂

Comment: I did not switch. I use Windows, Mac OS and Linux daily.  Each has features that I find valuable so why would I want to lose that?

I started to use Linux regularly from the first time I became aware of it. A friend gave me a PC World cover disk (remember those?) with Slackware 2.0, I think, in 1994.  It was in the form of many 1.44MB floppy images that had to be copied to disks and used to install. 

My past experience with "real computers" was VMS on a VAX 11/780 in school, and this created a love for powerful command line operating systems. Being able to run one on my home machine hooked me from day 1.

Comment: Had been sick of Windows for a while, didn't want 11 and then had an SSD failure in June. Stuck Linux on just because and 40 minutes later had a fully functional PC again. Never went back to Windows, haven't missed it, everything is easier, penguin supremacy, etc.
