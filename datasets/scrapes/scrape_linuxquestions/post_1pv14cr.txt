Hi, recently I have been wanting to learn how to use Linux and I have been looking for ways to learn how to use it, the best way that I found was to go through the Linux foundation education but I’m still not sure if it’s a good way to start.

Comment: Start using it, eiter on an old computer or in VirualBox or other virtual environment.  
It's like if you take the theory exam to drive a car you have no clue how to drive in winter conditions on icy roads.

Comment: Repeating for emphasis. Learn by doing. Be it VirtualBox or an old machine. No better way to learn.

Install it and start doing computer things.

Comment: forget VM.

you need to use Linux to know it, and you need to use it on real hardware, with a real video card, with real wifi, bluetooth, sound card, and everything else.

however, before installing, the best thing is to use a thumbdrive formatted with VENTOY in GPT mode and move several Linux distros to it and try them out without installing anything, all in liveUSB mode.

Linux has real difficulties on real hardware and using the system necessarily involves experimenting and overcoming these difficulties.

this is what you need to expose yourself to and learn to deal with.

the rest is application. and the vast majority of applications can be used on any operating system with greater or lesser effort.
