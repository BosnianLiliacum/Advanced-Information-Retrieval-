Comment: \#1:  
Prometheus + Grafana and then set up all kinds of monitoring and alerting

\#2:  
Wazuh - and learn about vulnerabilities and move the configuration beyond just the basic default you get with installation.

\#3: Harden security further.  rkhunter, tripwire, and lynis.  Fix everything you can that is highlighted in the lynis report and you will learn more about linux than any other way.

Comment: It depends on your goals and what you want to use Linux for. If you just want to be a desktop linux user then simply install a distro and use it and configure/fix things as you go.


I'm not a sysadmin or networking expert by any means, but to develop some general Linux sysadmin skills you might check out the Linux Bible by Christopher Negus:

I used an earlier version of this years ago, it will take you through the basics of installation, using the command line, local admin, and server admin/security.

Comment: if you are already aware on linux basics, i'd suggest these

* run your own home server
* write a systemd service from scratch and manage its lifecycle properly
* stress test a machine (cpu, memory, io)
* build a simple logging + alerting setup and trigger failures
* tune kernel / sysctl settings
