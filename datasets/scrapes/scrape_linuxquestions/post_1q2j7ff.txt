This isn’t about what you don’t know.

  
It’s about those everyday Linux things we keep using and think, *“I should really dig into this someday.”*

Beginners, veterans — everyone’s welcome.

Comment: getty, tty, vconsole, terminal. Every time I wonder why the most prominent feature of a linux based OS hasn't been updated in 20+ years, I get told I'm talking about the wrong thing. But kmscon is getting added to Fedora which potentially means RHEL in the future and I've always wondered how a modern shell on servers would change thing for data centers and what the professionals can do to automate things.
