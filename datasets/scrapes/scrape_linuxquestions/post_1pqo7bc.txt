I am a Systems Engineering student looking for a remote job as a Linux SysAdmin. I still have one year left before I get my Bachelor’s degree, but I already have experience managing Linux in datacenters (Red Hat distros) and IP telephony (Asterisk). So far, my experience has been informal, and I am now looking for a formal job that fits my studies. In your opinion, is it possible to get a remote SysAdmin or Embedded role (my true passion) without a degree? If so, how and where should I apply? Also, are Red Hat, Cisco Networking Academy, and Linux Foundation certifications useful for remote job applications?

Comment: Some grandpa advice here, but in my opinion the best bet you have is to invest all your energy in college for this one year, do *really* well in your exams and become a top ranker. When it comes to fresh grads academic performance is one of the first things recruiters look at while selecting candidates.

Comment: Certs is probably the move here, you need some proof that you know what you’re doing. When I was doing IT side certs would get you a job without a degree, not sure if that is still a thing though

Comment: Your post title and content don't agree.

System admin is a very different job from developers. Developers write code while system admin... well administers systems. Two very different professions.
