Been through some distro hopping, currently settled with Mint because it's the only distro that can natively read the OneDrive folder I have on an NTFS partition. All other distros I tried stumble on the "invalid reparse point" error. 
     
On one distro I spent some time fiddling with the NTFS-3G without success. 
   
Currently trying out Zorin OS and the same error. 
   
I don't want to sync or anything (I use RClone for that), I just want to be able to read the OneDrive folder just like I can in Mint. 
   
What does Mint have/do different from all other distros?

Comment: NTFS-3G is being replaced by NTFS3 on many distros. so perhaps thats part of the problem.

Mint and Zorin are both based on and thus closely related to Ubuntu,   so it seems odd that One can do it, and the other cant. 

a Quick google for "invalid reparse point"   points to the NTFS having filesystem issues. But that may be just part of the issue going on.


There may be some extra tool or service installed on Mint.

Comment: Reading the OneDrive folder on Linux - on any distribution requires a very specific version of NTFS-3G tooling.

I describe this in detail here: [https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/advanced-usage.md#accessing-windows-onedrive-files-from-linux-dual-boot-setup](https://github.com/abraunegg/onedrive/blob/master/docs/advanced-usage.md#accessing-windows-onedrive-files-from-linux-dual-boot-setup)

This is the only method to reliably read OneDrive folder data from NTFS under Linux.

Comment: i'd run the following command and see what the output is on all distros you've tried:

```zgrep CONFIG_NTFS_FS /proc/config.gz```

this will tell you the state of the native ntfs kernel driver. i can't remember the last time i even looked cockeyed at an NTFS partition (it was certainly prior to 2021 when the ntfs3 kernel driver was released) so i have no idea if this is better than NTFS-3G, but it's certainly _different_.

Comment: I can't solve the issue because I'd rather saw my legs off with an old boot than use one drive buuuut... The error refers to a reparse point, which is basically a Symlink in Windows.

Paragraph 2 here may be very beneficial in your problem solving:  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS\_reparse\_point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_reparse_point)

Interestingly, OneDrive stores data locally as normal NTFS objects but marks them as a reparse anyway. Not sure I understand why unless it's require for cloud sync.

Comment: Are the files actually on the NTFS drive, or are they virtual file pointers?
