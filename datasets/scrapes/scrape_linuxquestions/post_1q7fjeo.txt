Comment: As I understand it, quite a number are available.

Jitsi Meet is widely used and based on my experience is a solid alternative.

Like many "Zoom alternatives", though, Jitsi Meet is an alternative *platform* and does not allow users to sign into Zoom or other platforms.

My best and good luck.

Comment: It might be helpful to outline what you want to use it for. For instance Zoom is great if you need to send an invitation to a group of people who don’t have logins and don’t have much technical skill, but those criteria might not matter to you if you want to do 1:1 conversations with someone who doesn’t mind setting up their machine. So:

* can you persuade people to install an app to talk with you?
* 1:1 or groups?
* do you care if people need accounts?
* mobile and / or desktop?
* do you have any security or privacy requirements?

Comment: I used these two in past-  
\- Jitsi  
\- Nextcloud Talk

Both of these support self-hosting as well.
