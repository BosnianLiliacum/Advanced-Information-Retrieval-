Hi everyone,

I switched to Ubuntu 6 months ago and I genuinely love it. It feels far better than Windows, and for the first time, I feel like I actually "belong" to the Linux world.

However, I have a major productivity issue. On Windows, I used "Cold Turkey" to block distracting websites. It was perfect because it is extremely hard to bypass (system-level blocking, no easy "off" switch).

On Ubuntu, I haven't found a true alternative.  
**- I tried /etc/hosts:** It's too easy for me to just `sudo nano` and revert it when I have an urge.  
**- I tried Pluckeye:** It seems to struggle with the default Ubuntu Firefox (likely due to Snap/sandboxing issues).   
**- Extensions:** LeechBlock/StayFocusd are too easy to disable.

I am seriously considering moving back to Windows just for Cold Turkey, which makes me really sad because I love my current setup.

**My Question:** Is there a "hardcore," impossible-to-bypass tool for Ubuntu? I need something that can block domains system-wide (or lock down Firefox policies) and cannot be easily reversed during a focused session.

I’m looking for a technical solution, ideally something that persists even if I try to cheat. I really want to stay on this OS.

Thanks in advance.

Comment: This seems like something a therapist can be more helpful with, on linux you are given control over everything, every obstacle you set yourself you can easily undo.

Could maybe make a secondary user with very specific permissions to software access, no sudo access, let a partner or friend set the root password.

Comment: Make a boot option which doesn't start your gui AND which disallows running of anything which starts one.

Or get therapy to help you learn how to control distracting urges - and seek an assessment for ADHD and resources to help you learn to cope if diagnosed; if not diagnosed, learn how to control your impulses.

Comment: Create a systemd service set that (1) watches /etc/hosts and reverts attempts to remove blocks, and (2) ensures at least N instances of the service are running at all times, launching/unmasking the service as necessary. It should be possible to make it so that even with sudo permissions, the service continually restarts itself despite your best attempts to kill it. I think the easiest way to bypass would be to create a new service that runs before the blocking service launches, and make sure this runs at boot, and then reboot the device.
