That moment when something suddenly stops working on Linux.

What was the last issue that made you say this?

Comment: Nope, sorry. I use debian.

Any situation that would call out the expression "it worked yesterday", has been preceded by me "optimising". Over the years, even before landing on debian, I've learned to backup files I'm going to change so I can restore them quickly and easily, and reboot or restart relevant services to test my changes.

I've used headless linux professionally before I became a daily driver and was very aware that if something "just stopped working", it was almost exclusively a result of something I did wrong. Unless you insist on using one of the bleeding edge distros that are more prone to breakage, it's a pretty safe conclusion to make.

One thing that is almost a surefire way of breaking your install is forcing installing held-back package upgrades. Assume packages are held back for a good reason.

Comment: That's how it used to be, 10-20 years ago. I was afraid of every update. Those days are long gone if you choose a stable distribution. Linux Mint has been running on my notebook for years and everything works like it did on the first day.
