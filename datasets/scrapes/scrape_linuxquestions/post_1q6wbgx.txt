Sorry if it has been asked before. I know the question about alternatives to Microsoft Office has been asked a million times, but this is specific to a Office alternative that can support a macro enabled document.

I have a couple word documents that are used for work that take a .xml file and auto fills information into the document.

Worse case I know I can just dual boot Windows and Linux. It would just be nice if any of the alternatives had that support.

Edit: Crazy to come to a subreddit that is specifically for asking questions, and to ask a question because I want to join the community to only be downvoted for asking a question. Wild.

Comment: LibreOffice has partial support for Microsoft Office macros.


Full support is impossible - VBA macros are basically actual programs, with access to the whole win32 API and more.


However, most macros just use a relatively small set of functions intended specifically for Office macros, so it's worth at least checking if yours work.

Comment: Word's "macros" are written in Visual Basic. Unless you're using the fields features and embedded calculations. Without more information, it's going to be hard to answer your question.

What I can say is that different word processors have different macro and scripting options. WordPerfect's macro and scripting system is insanely powerful (if not a bit clunky). Lotus Smartsuite used LotusScript, which was similar to Visual Basic, but also had "powerfields", which was mostly for database merges.

Please explain in more detail what you're asking about. Thanks.

Comment: * If you are not yanking system DLL's, LibreOffice is usually sufficient.
* If you were using system DLLs to do what you need to do, use actual programming languages with Libreoffice API ([uno](https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/sbasic/shared/uno_objects.html))

Comment: Libre office has some macro support.

But generally on linux you do it a bit differently:

You have a script which composes the text the way you like. This way you have much greater flexibility. Then you push it into word processor if you need that.

What I would do is to have a perl/php/java/python script/app which will assemble the content and then either push it to doc file (java/python) or to html file and then into word processor.

In your case it may be different.

Your worst case is not dualboot. Its a VM with windows and office or a remote cloud instance with office (like amazon workspaces or similar)
