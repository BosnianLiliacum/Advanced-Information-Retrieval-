I installed llama3.1-70b model in my ollama for laptop, tested, works even its too slow. 

  
Then i transferred the sha- blob file into my more powerful computer with http-server, ( I did this before for other models like gemma2:27b and worked without problem) 

But llama3.1-70 is giving random charachters as a response. Don't know why. It gives response ( so we can think file transfer have no problem )  or we cant?

BTw, i stopped it, because there is not end, it continuesly spitting out random chars

  Comment: I had that when I tried to run an AI model I had just downloaded.  
Like Vir\_db says, just rm remove it and download it again.
