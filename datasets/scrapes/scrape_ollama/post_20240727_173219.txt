I have ollama installed using snap on Ubuntu 22. ollama -v gives version 0.0.0. Snap info ollama shows 0.1.32, however snap refresh ollama says there is no update even though I know we are at 0.1.49.

Has anyone run into this with snap? How do I get ollama to update using it? I would like to try Gemma2.

thanks

  Comment: We actually nearly at 0.3.0 now. I think it's snap package maintainers are not keeping up with ollama updates.

Try switching to brew package - it's pretty good and currently at 0.2.8.
