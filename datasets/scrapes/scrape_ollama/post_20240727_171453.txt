I'm excited to announce the release of Belullama, a comprehensive AI application that bundles the latest versions of Ollama, Open WebUI, and Automatic1111 (Stable Diffusion WebUI) into a single, easy-to-use package.

  Comment: Thanks,

Just installed. Here are some notes: 

Ollama issue:

Can't complete install if you have ollama already installed. This should be enough to complete install [https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/linux.md)

    sudo systemctl stop ollama
    sudo systemctl disable ollama

Install went fine and I ended up with v0.2.7 then I ran ollama install/update script

`curl -fsSL` [`https://ollama.com/install.sh`](https://ollama.com/install.sh) `| sh`

That got me to the latest version v0.3.0 

Either way I did lose connection to all downloaded models. Later I'll figure out how to link the ollama Docker install to my models (usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models) so I don't have to re-download each model.

WebUI issue:

Didn't recognize my login, so I just created using same info:

Stable Diffusion issue:

My system is running GTX 1070 8gb Vram but SD not utilizing when I ran first test. Regular Automatic1111 SD install works great with my GTX 1070 so I'm guessing the Docker just isn't talking with my OS to find the GPU. I'll figure that out later also. I didn't have SD already install on this system (Kubuntu 24.04). Maybe I'll wipe and try a fresh clean install if someone comments that they had everything working first install. Either way, love it !!!!

  Comment: How does it different from ollama + open-webui? I have been using the same for quite some time and would like to explore this if there are extra benefits. Thanks.
