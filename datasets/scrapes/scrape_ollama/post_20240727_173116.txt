i wanted to have a look at the documentation, they give a link at the top of the license but there's nothing there? lol. great QA by the giants

&gt;“Documentation” means the specifications, manuals and documentation accompanying Llama 3.1 distributed by Meta at [https://llama.meta.com/doc/overview](https://llama.meta.com/doc/overview).

is there some hidden conspiracy or does the docs exist at all... i'll have a quick look then give up no doubt, not sure why i'm looking anyway hahaha

  Comment: took me literally 0.5 seconds to google llama meta docs

https://llama.meta.com/docs/overview

you're missing an S in your URL, it's docs/overview, not doc/overview
