In the current Ollama version 0.3.0, it states that the new Llama 3 models are available:

&gt;"Llama 3.1: A new state-of-the-art model from Meta available in 8B, 70B, and 405B parameter sizes with support for tool calling."

However, I believe tool calling is not yet functional with ollama. Is this correct?

I'm particularly interested in the new "code interpreter" feature, but I haven't had success with it (I'm using Ollama/OpenWebUI). I attempted to load a CSV file and create a scatter plot (similar to the example Meta demonstrated). When I tried it in OpenWebUI, I receive the following output so I guess it's not functional:

    &lt;|reserved_special_token_5|&gt;
    import pandas as pd
    [...]
    &lt;|reserved_special_token_4|&gt;

Am I doing something incorrectly, or does Ollama not support tool calling yet?
