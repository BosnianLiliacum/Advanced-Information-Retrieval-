Hi, all. I'm currently starting to research some work in the VLA field. And I'd like to discuss which cutting-edge work has solved interesting problems, and which remain unresolved but are worth exploring.

 Any suggestions or discussions are welcomed, thank you!

Comment: Vision models are terrible right now.  for example, i can few shot prompt with medical data or radar data that is very easy for a human to learn from and the VLA/VLM does terrible interpreting it.  This is not generic human perception.  There is MUCH work to do this space.
