Looking for a JAX dataloader that is fast, lightweight, and flexible? Try out Cyreal!

[GitHub](https://github.com/smorad/cyreal)  [Documentation](https://smorad.github.io/cyreal/cyreal.html)

**Note:** This is a new library and probably full of bugs. If you find one, please file an issue.

**Background**

JAX is a great library but the lack of dataloaders has been driving me crazy. I find it crazy that [Google's own documentation often recommends using the Torch dataloader](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/Neural_Network_and_Data_Loading.html). Installing JAX and Torch together inevitably pulls in gigabytes of dependencies and conflicting CUDA versions, often breaking each other.

Fortunately, Google has been investing effort into [Grain, a first-class JAX dataloader](https://github.com/google/grain). Unfortunately, [it still relies on Torch or Tensorflow to download datasets](https://google-grain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/data_loader_tutorial.html#dataloader-guide), defeating the purpose of a JAX-native dataloader and forcing the user back into dependency hell. Furthermore, the Grain dataloader can be quite slow [\[1\]](https://github.com/google/grain/issues/569) [\[2\]](https://github.com/google/grain/issues/851) [\[3\]](https://github.com/google/grain/issues/1164).

And so, I decided to create a JAX dataloader library called Cyreal. Cyreal is unique in that:

* It has no dependencies besides JAX
* It is JITtable and fast
* It downloads its own datasets similar to TorchVision
* It provides Transforms similar to the the Torch dataloader
* It support in-memory, in-GPU-memory, and streaming disk-backed datasets
* It has tools for RL and continual learning like Gymnax datasources and replay buffers

Comment: It looks nice! I haven’t had major problems with Grain so far, but I suppose the trick is that you when you have data workers enabled it just needs to load the next batch faster than one training/validation step.

Comment: What transforms do torch data loaders provide? Is this an AI hallucination?

Comment: Hey, it seems nice! I was just searching for alternatives to Grain as I was facing the same negative points you point out:

On the other hand, how do you compare Cyreal to [jax-dataloader](https://github.com/BirkhoffG/jax-dataloader) ? It seems both projects share many points.
