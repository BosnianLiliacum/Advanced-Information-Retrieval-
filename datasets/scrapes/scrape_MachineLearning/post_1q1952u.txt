I’ve been thinking about how we should reason over images and videos once we move beyond single-frame understanding.

End-to-end VLMs are impressive, but in practice I’ve found them brittle when dealing with:

* long or high-FPS videos,
* stable tracking over time,
* and exact spatial or count-based reasoning.

This pushed me toward a more modular setup:

Use specialized vision models for perception (detection, tracking, metrics), and let an LLM reason over structured outputs instead of raw pixels.

Some examples of reasoning tasks I care about:

* event-based counting in traffic videos,
* tracking state changes over time,
* grounding explanations to specific detected objects,
* avoiding hallucinated references in video explanations.

I’m curious how people here think about this tradeoff:

* Where do modular pipelines outperform end-to-end VLMs?
* What reasoning tasks are still poorly handled by current video models?
* Do you see LLMs as a post-hoc reasoning layer, or something more tightly integrated?

I’ve built this idea into a small Python library and added a short demo video showing image and video queries end-to-end.

Happy to share details or discuss design choices if useful.

Comment: Totally agree on the modular approach for complex video tasks. End-to-end VLMs are cool but yeah, they fall apart on longer videos or when you need precise tracking/counting.
Your pipeline idea makes sense - let specialized models handle what they’re good at, then have LLMs reason over the structured outputs. Much more reliable than trying to get a VLM to track objects frame-by-frame.
The Python library sounds interesting! Are you running this stuff locally or do you need serious compute for the video processing pipeline? Some of those detection/tracking models can get pretty heavy on longer videos.

Comment: For anyone interested, I’ve open-sourced a Python library that explores this modular approach and added a short demo video here:
