I'm sharing LiteEvo, an open-source tool designed to make it easier for researchers and developers to experiment with Self-Evolution.

**What is Self-Evolution?**

In short, it's a technique where an agent improves its performance on a specific task by learning from its own past attempts. Instead of fine-tuning model weights (which is slow/expensive), the model reflects on its successes and failures to iteratively refine a "Playbook"—a structured set of strategies and heuristics that guide its future actions.

**The Problem:**

Even though the concept is promising, setting up the infrastructure to test self-evolution (managing feedback loops, batching attempts, and distilling insights) usually requires building a custom pipeline from scratch.

**How LiteEvo lowers the barrier:**

I built LiteEvo to turn this into a one-command process. It handles the scaffolding so you can focus on the results:

* **The Loop:** You provide a task and a success criterion. The model attempts the task, reflects on what worked and what didn't, and updates its strategy.
* **Structured Learning:**  It distills learned insights into a "Playbook." This allows you to inspect exactly how the model's reasoning evolved over iterations.

Whether you are a researcher exploring self-improvement loops or an engineer trying to optimize a complex agentic workflow, LiteEvo makes the process reproducible and accessible without needing a cluster of GPUs for fine-tuning.

I'm a solo dev and would love to hear your thoughts on this approach. If you've been curious about self-evolving agents but didn't want to deal with the plumbing, I hope this helps!

Comment: Is it updating its strategy after each run? If so, how do you prevent it from over-correcting based on a single run / losing a better existing strategy?  I'm new to this approach.
