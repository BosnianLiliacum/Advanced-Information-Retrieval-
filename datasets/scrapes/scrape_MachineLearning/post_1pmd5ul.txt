Hi, asking if a unified resource emerged on Causal ML. To be clear, I am asking specifically (and kindly) for a coherent and comparative discussion of some of the more recent advances (10y). I am hoping for a research survey/primer or a graduate textbook. 

It would be ideal that the resource situates causal ML within the better understood and widely adopted class of causal inference tools (e.g endogenous causal identification from  econometrics).

Comment: [This](https://causalml-book.org/), from the Double ML folks, is probably the best, most recent overview. And free online!

I find the notation much more friendly for ML folk.
