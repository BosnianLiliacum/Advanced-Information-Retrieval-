Hey everyone!

I recently spent a couple of weekends improving Karpathy's excellent LLM Council Open Source Project.

The [original project](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council) was brilliant but lacked usability and flexibility imho.

**What I added:**

* Web search integration (DuckDuckGo, Tavily, Brave, Jina AI)
* Clean Modern UI with a settings page to support:
   * Support for multiple API providers (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
   * Customizable system prompts and temperature controls (the custom prompts open up tons of use cases beyond a "council")
   * Export &amp; Import of councils, prompts, and settings (for backup and even sharing)
   * Control the council size (from 1 to 8 - original only supported 3)
* Full Ollama support for local models
* "I'm Feeling Lucky" random model selector
* Filter only Free models on OpenRouter (although Rate Limits can be an issue)
* Control the Process, from a simple asking multiple models a question in parallel (Chat Only), Chat &amp; peer rating where models rate the responses of other models, and Full end-to-end deliberation where the Chairman model makes the final decision on the best answer

You can compare up to 8 models simultaneously, watch them deliberate, and see rankings.

Perfect for comparing local models or commercial models via APIs.

Would love to hear your thoughts - it was made with a lot of love and attention to detail, and now I am sharing it with you!

Comment: Take a look at [MassGen](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen) it's pretty similar and quite advanced at this point
