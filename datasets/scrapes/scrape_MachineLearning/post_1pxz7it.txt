For those doing AI/ML research or engineering:

1. How do you currently discover and track new research?
2. What's the most frustrating part of your research workflow?
3. How much time per week do you spend on research/staying current?

Genuinely curious how others handle this and how much time you’re spending. Thanks!

Comment: Author notifications on Scholar along with searching accepted papers at conferences (mostly ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS, and AAMAS) for keywords that I work on. Also Twitter

Huge backlog since it's hard to determine how much signal a paper represents and there's so many of them. Have started having LLMs determine what's worth reading, but still calibrating how good it is at this

10-12 hours a week (but I'm a 3rd year PhD student) on reading

Comment: My niche has seminal papers that are usually cited in related works section of papers that would be relevant to me. I track citations to those paper through Google scholar, which is straightforward to set up.


I am also tuning scholar-inbox recommendation algorithms. https://www.scholar-inbox.com/
The tool send you a digested list of new papers along with a relevance score. Very useful to avoid the need to browse conference proceedings.

Comment: I know someone who spends time reading the title and abstract of every single paper that appears in top conferences. If he finds a paper interesting, he continues reading it. He just spent an entire week reading everything from NeurIPS. And whenever I want to find papers, I just ask him.

Comment: I use -&gt; [https://www.semanticscholar.org/](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) 

Basically, it lets you do semantic searches based on papers added to your library, and it gives you updates when new papers match your profile.

Comment: Authors and labs that I trust because I have tested their code can reproduce and repeat their experiments. Can’t read all of them and I have made peace with not knowing all of them. My field is niche combinatorial with reinforcement learning. So it helps.
