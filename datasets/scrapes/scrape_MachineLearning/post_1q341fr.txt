Post Content:
I built an interactive demo to understand DeepSeek's new mHC paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24880).

**The problem:** Hyper-Connections use learned matrices to mix residual streams. Stacking 64 layers multiplies these matrices together, and small amplifications compound to 10^16.

**The fix:** Project matrices onto the doubly stochastic manifold using Sinkhorn-Knopp. Since doubly stochastic matrices are closed under multiplication, the composite mapping stays bounded at any depth.

**The surprise:** One Sinkhorn iteration is enough. At k=0, gain = 10^16. At k=1, gain ≈ 1.

**Interactive demo:** https://subhadipmitra.com/mhc-visualizer (drag the "Sinkhorn iterations" slider and watch the lines change)

**Full writeup:** https://subhadipmitra.com/blog/2026/deepseek-mhc-manifold-constrained-hyper-connections/

**Code:** https://github.com/bassrehab/mhc-visualizer

Includes PyTorch implementation if anyone wants to try it in their own models.

Comment: Thanks, very cool. How does this compare to spectral normalisation that's used in GANs?

Comment: Something I was interested in was seeing what multiplying 64 of these matrices look like? On the one hand, they are closed under multiplication, but the eigenvalues are systematically pushed down to 0 except one that is by construction always equal to 1. So do the last layers necessarily only have the average of the first layer? (the matrix with 1/N on each entry)
