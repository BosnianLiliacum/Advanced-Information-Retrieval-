Post Content:
The paper argue that current System 1 (fast intuition) and System 2 (slow reasoning) architectures make agents feel "amnesiac" and purely reactive.

They propose Sophia, a framework that adds a "System 3" layer to handle persistence and narrative identity.

* Instead of just standard RAG, it maintains a continuous "autobiographical" record to ensure the agent's "identity" stays consistent over long periods.
* For recurring tasks, the agent transforms repetitive deliberation into a self-driven process, significantly cutting down on reasoning by \~80%.
* It uses a hybrid reward system (internal + external) to drive autonomous behavior so it isn't just waiting for a human prompt

It’s a pretty interesting take on making agents function more as long-lived entities.

Comment: **Thanks for sharing.**

**Without Intelligence (Volcano):** The system follows the path of least resistance (Maximum Entropy Production), exploding or decaying randomly.

**With Intelligence (Garden):** The system “models the generative process” (understands the thermodynamics) and intervenes. It uses information (DNA, or in Kawasaki’s case, logistics plans) to **delay** entropy production, capturing that energy to build complex structures first.

What System 3 is all about, management of entropy for stability and navigation of chaos.
