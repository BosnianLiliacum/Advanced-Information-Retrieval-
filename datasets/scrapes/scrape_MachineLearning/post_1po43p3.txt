Post Content:
We studied *denoising language models* (error correction models) as an alternative to standard language models.

Denoising LMs use an encoder-decoder architecture, and are trained to reconstruct the original text from a corrupted version of it.
We test them for speech recognition, and specifically train them on errors made by a standard speech recognition system.
We use the *data-constrained setting* where we have limited paired data (speech + transcript) and large amounts of unpaired text data.

* Clear improvements over a very competitive baseline with standard language models.

* State-of-the-art results on LibriSpeech under the data-constrained setting.

* Scaling laws: Similar behavior as for *diffusion LMs*: For data-constrained setting, the amount of compute matters: With less compute, standard LMs are better, but at some point, denoising LMs become better (see Figure 2).

* Decoding speed with denoising LM is faster than with standard LM.

* Very comprehensive study.

* Reproducing same findings on the [Loquacious dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/speechbrain/LoquaciousSet).

* Public recipes.

And much more in the paper.

Comment: 80 pages ? Damn.
I am mostly using standard transformer encoder (ctc) with a ngram LM ,  is it really worth to have a heavier decoder ?
