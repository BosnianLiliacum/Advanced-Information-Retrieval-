Sounds like a further improvement in the spirit of HRM &amp; TRM models.   

53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2

I continue to be fascinated by these architectures that: 

\- Build in recurrence / inference scaling to transformers more natively.

\- Don't use full recurrent gradient traces, and succeed not just despite, but \*because\* of that.

Comment: I'm feeling a bit suspicious of this paper. I'm not doubting their URM results but the sudoku numbers have a HUGE divergence from the reported TRM numbers (which I have validated and run myself). Also they report all the passes for ARC-AGI except Pass@2 which is what the TRM paper actually reports. I've run all the experiments from the TRM paper and all the results were +-2 from what it's reported in their paper.

Closer look EDIT:

The Backpropagation novelty they talk about, they basically did one of the failed ideas they tried in the TRM paper in Section 6. Specifically, it is the paragraph discussing decoupling the recursion depth (n) from the backpropagation depth (k). ITS THE EXACT THE SAME THING, the only difference is the loss calculation, URM calculates a loss term for every single step inside the gradient window (dense signal) while TRM calculated loss at the very end of the k steps (Sparse). The URM paper frames TBPTL as a novel contribution to stability. However, TRM had already solved the stability problem using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on weights.

Comment: The difference with TRM is that they change the trick not to backpropagate on every loop, and they do more token mixing because the FFN is not element-wise, which is overall a bit like hiding the incremental modifications on TRM without claiming how derivative these models are. Even the name Universal seems a kind of McGuffin to avoid citing HRM and TRM, even though Universal Transformers are older than HRM and TRM.


I am a fan of TRM and I find it hard to appreciate this abstract. 


Btw also the twitter post seems a bit oblivious of HRM, TRM, RNNs...

Comment: To earn “universal” in a strict sense, you would expect evidence of at least some of the following:

1. **Out-of-distribution transfer** across task families (not just ARC/Sudoku variants).
2. **Cross-modality robustness** (text-only to vision, or vice versa) without bespoke scaffolding.
3. **Stable behavior under domain shift** (the same optimization target does not degrade into proxy pursuit).
4. **Tool-and-action governance invariants** (constraints that persist when the action space expands).

None of that is claimed or demonstrated here; the scope is closer to “UT-family reasoning on ARC-like tasks.”
