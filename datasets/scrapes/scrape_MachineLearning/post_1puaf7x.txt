Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on [PixelBank](https://pixelbank.dev) \- a hands-on coding practice platform designed specifically for Machine Learning and AI.

Link: [https://pixelbank.dev](https://pixelbank.dev)



Why I built this:

LeetCode is great for DSA, but when I was prepping for ML Engineer interviews, I couldn't find anywhere to actually practice writing PyTorch models, NumPy operations, or CV algorithms with instant feedback. So I built it.

What you can practice:

🔥 PyTorch - Datasets, transforms, model building, training loops

📊 NumPy - Array manipulation, slicing, broadcasting, I/O operations

👁️ Computer Vision - Image processing, filters, histograms, Haar cascades

🧠 Deep Learning - Activation functions, regularization, optimization

🔄 RNNs - Sequence modeling and more

How it works:

Pick a problem from organized Collections → Topics

Write your solution in the Monaco editor (same as VS Code)

Hit run - your code executes against test cases with instant feedback

Track your progress on the leaderboard

Features:

✅ Daily challenges to build consistency

✅ Math equations rendered beautifully (LaTeX/KaTeX)

✅ Hints and solutions when you're stuck

✅ Dark mode (the only mode 😎)

✅ Progress tracking and streaks

The platform is free to use with optional premium for additional problems.

Would love feedback from the community! What topics would you want to see added?

Comment: No offense but spreading the gamification of interviewing to computer vision and ML isn’t something I’m excited about, no matter how well this idea is executed.

Comment: Idea is kind of nice, but I am too uswd to being able to do code challenges for free, so I wouldn't pay for it personally.

Comment: I like the idea. Are you planning to provide also video lectures for topics that you are covering ? And what about training models. I see a Deep Learning category. How are you handling many people connected at the same time trying to send you a training request ?
