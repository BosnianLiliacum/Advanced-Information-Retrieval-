Post Content:
I recently defended my PhD thesis at Cambridge and wrote a blog post reflecting on the journey. The thesis focuses on Geometric Deep Learning and moves from pure theory to wet-lab applications.

I broke the research down into three main questions:

1. **Expressivity:** How do we characterize the power of 3D representations? (Introducing the Geometric Weisfeiler-Leman Test).
2. **Generative Modelling:** Can we build unified models for periodic and non-periodic systems? (Proposing the All-atom Diffusion Transformer).
3. **Real-world Design:** Can generative AI actually design functional RNA? (Developing gRNAde and validating it with wet-lab experiments).

It covers the transition from working on graph isomorphism problems to training large diffusion models and finally collaborating with biologists to test our designs in vitro.

Full post here if you're interested: [https://chaitjo.substack.com/p/phd-thesis-in-three-questions](https://chaitjo.substack.com/p/phd-thesis-in-three-questions)

Would love to discuss the current state of AI for Science or the transition from theory to application!

Comment: Hey Chaitanya,

I've been a big fan of yours since gRNAde. I am curious about your opinions on the following couple. Thank you in advance.

1. How do you see the equivariant models going with all going on? Do you think their role will change as the scale + data augmentation can overcome some of the use cases? I've read your posts on this but curious if your opinion changed with time. I am especially curious how you think this reflects to choice of models in industry. 

2. What do you think is the way to test transfer learning in the models. For example you all atom diffusion is SOTA but to what extent can you say/how can you detect joint training increased representation learning. I might be looking at this in the wrong way tho.

3. What are some of the hard lessons you've learned about the field in your phd. Especially in the wet lab validation phase.

4. I am curious is what is next for you. I have been following your work since 2023 and as an undergrad wasn't sure on what he wanted to do, I have to say you've inspired me a lot. Unfortunately I missed your talk in netherlands a couple months before but please if you ever come to netherlands for a talk, post it on X.

Comment: Where do you get the initial training structures? Is it from X-ray of crystal or do you use ab initio methods? 

How do you deal in both case with the fact that X-ray describes usually "unbiologically frozen" crystal and therefore it is different than in vivo structure or in a case of ab initio that the most ab initio method useful for such large systems are too costly and the approximate methods are often qualitatively wrong?
