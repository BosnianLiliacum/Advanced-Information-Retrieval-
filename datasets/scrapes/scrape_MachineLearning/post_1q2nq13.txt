New paper from ByteDance Seed team exploring latent generative modeling for text. Latent generative models are very popular for video and image diffusion models, but they haven’t been used for text a lot. Do you think this direction is promising?

Comment: Latent space learning is a promising direction but I'm not sure whether LLM still is nowadays

Comment: I’m very curious on how continuous representations would alter performance on VLMs. It seems like we would naturally converge to similar latent representations, and might provide further evidence for the platonic representation hypothesis.

Comment: Most research appears to be moving toward latent diffusion for language. The issue is mostly the continuous to discrete problem and misapplication of methods imo.
