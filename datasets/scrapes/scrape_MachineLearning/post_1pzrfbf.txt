Comment: What I personally felt throughout this year that several reasoning models are already achieving gold-level performance in major math competitions. On the top of that,  MCP has already become the standard for tool and data access in agent-style LLM systems (for now)   
Also I'm predicting that the open-weight community will slowly but steadily adopt LLMs with local tool use and increasingly agentic capabilities. A lot of LLM benchmark and performance progress will come from improved tooling and inference-time scaling rather than from training or the core model itself.
