Hey everyone,

Quick update on TraceML **the dashboard is done** and you can now see exactly how much time each layer takes on GPU vs CPU during training.

**What's new:**

🎯 **Layer-by-layer timing breakdown** showing where your training time actually goes (forward, backward, per-layer)

📊**Live dashboard** that updates as you train, no more guessing which layers are bottlenecks

⚡ **Low overhead: On NVIDIA T4** in real PyTorch/HuggingFace training runs ( profiling that doesn't kill your throughput)

Why this matters

Ever wonder why your model takes forever to train? Or which layers are eating all your time? Now you can actually *see* it while training, not just guess from total step time.

Perfect for:

* Debugging slow training runs
* Finding unexpected bottlenecks before they waste hours
* Optimizing mixed-precision setups
* Understanding where CPU/GPU sync is hurting you

Working on DDP support and testing on bigger GPUs. If you try it out, I'd love to hear what you find—especially any surprising bottlenecks.

**⭐ Star if useful** | Feedback welcome

Comment: this looks sweet! is there any way to sync logs to something like wandb?
