I made an ML library in the browser that can run neural networks and has full support for JIT compilation to WebGPU and so on.

Lots of past great work on "*runtimes*" for ML on the browser, like ONNX / LiteRT / TVM / TensorFlow.js, where you export a model to a pre-packaged format and then run it from the web. But I think the programming model of these is quite different from an actual research library (PyTorch, JAX) — you don't get the same autograd, JIT compilation, productivity and flexibility.

Anyway this is a new library that runs totally on the frontend, perhaps the most "interactive" ML library. Some self-contained demos if you're curious to try it out :D

Comment: Been looking forward to this, cool to see its out now.

Do you think it would perform better than onnxruntime-web?

Comment: This is awesome, I'm gonna try to implement the cholesky stuff, I'm currently building a Gaussian Process visual web app. Really needed something like this.
