I'm planning to self-host an AI compute cluster instead of burning cash on cloud GPU rentals, and I'm trying to get realistic numbers for colocation costs in Texas.

**My setup:**

* 8x NVIDIA B200 GPUs (192GB HBM3e each)
* \~7kW total power draw under full load
* 112 CPU cores, 2TB RAM, 33TB NVMe storage
* Will run 24/7 for AI training and LLM inference

**What I'm trying to figure out:**

* What's a reasonable $/kW/month rate for colocation in Texas?
* Should I expect to pay per kW or per rack unit?
* What's typical for power costs ($/kWh) on top of colocation?
* Any hidden fees I should watch out for (cross-connects, hands-on support, etc.)?

**Context:** I just read about a European startup that broke even on their B200 purchase in 6-8 months by self-hosting vs. renting cloud H100s. They were paying around $3k/month total for colocation + power in Norway. Texas power should be cheaper, but I'm not sure what the facility/colocation premiums look like.

I've reached out to CoreScientific and a few others, but wanted to get a reality check from people who've actually done this before I commit to anything.

**Questions:**

1. Anyone colocating GPU clusters in Texas? What are you paying?
2. Which datacenters have you had good experiences with for AI workloads?
3. Am I missing any major cost factors?
4. At what point does it make more sense to just rent a small cage vs. cabinet space?

Trying to get my numbers dialed in before I drop $400k+ on hardware. Any insights appreciated!

Comment: $600 for a full rack with 10kw. More if you need A/B power or cross connects to multiple backbone providers. Texas does charge real estate tax to Colo.

Comment: Colocation pricing in Texas runs $200 to $400 per kW monthly for cabinet space. Power itself is $0.08 to $0.12 per kWh. At 7kW continuous, expect roughly $1,400 to $2,800 monthly for colocation plus another $500 to $600 for power.

The $3k/month European startup paid sounds right but Texas won't necessarily be cheaper. Power is cheap here but facility costs are similar and Texas summer cooling drives up operational expenses.

Hidden costs that kill budgets: bandwidth overage charges, remote hands fees, cross-connect fees, and setup fees of $1k to $5k just to rack your gear.

Our clients running GPU clusters learned colocation only makes sense above certain utilization thresholds. If GPUs sit idle 30% of the time, cloud rental wins. You're betting $400k that you'll keep those B200s busy enough to justify capital outlay.

For 7kW, cabinet space makes more sense than cage. Cages make sense around 20-30kW when you need multiple racks. Most facilities charge per kW with minimum commitments.

CoreScientific is solid but priced for enterprise. Look at DataBank or CyrusOne facilities in Dallas or Austin for better rates.

Reality check on 6-8 month breakeven: assumes 100% utilization, no hardware failures, and stable cloud pricing. In practice you'll have downtime and issues. Budget 12-18 months for realistic breakeven.

Major missing costs: insurance for $400k hardware, travel costs when things break and remote hands can't fix it, and opportunity cost of capital in depreciating GPUs.

Economic tipping point for self-hosting is sustained 70%+ utilization over 18+ months. Below that, cloud flexibility beats capex. Bursty workloads favor cloud, production inference 24/7 favors colocation.

For Texas datacenters, Dallas has better connectivity and options than Austin or Houston. Avoid single-carrier facilities.

Serious consideration: buying B200s now locks you in for years while cloud providers will have newer hardware within 18 months. Hardware depreciation in AI is brutal.

Comment: I’d see if you can keep a p6-b200 well utilized / shared among teams for a month before doing this.

Comment: I used to colo my gpus, but I've just brought them all home and self host.  Got fiber to the house.   Just a bit of extra heat to deal with.
