I've been working on cuLSH, a GPU-accelerated library for Locality Sensitive Hashing.

**Main Features:**

* **Scikit-Learn Style API:** Uses a familiar `fit()` / `query()` style API for building and searching the LSH index.
* **CUDA-native:** All components (projection generation, hashing, indexing, querying), are performed on the GPU via custom kernels. 
* **End-to-End:** Not just a hasher; includes bucketed searching and candidate neighbor collection.

I know there are plenty of LSH implementations out there, but many focus purely on generating signatures rather than a full indexing/querying pipeline, so that was what I was going for. I'm aware LSH may be less popular in favor of graph-based algorithms, but I was really drawn to the theory of LSH, so it was a fun learning project. 

**GitHub link:** [https://github.com/rishic3/cuLSH](https://github.com/rishic3/cuLSH)

Would love some feedback on the API design or implementation, and suggestions for improvement!
