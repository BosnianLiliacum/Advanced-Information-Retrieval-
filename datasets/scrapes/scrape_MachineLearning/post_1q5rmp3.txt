Right now, operando characterisation at synchrotron beamlines is a bit of a spray and pray situation. We have faster detectors than ever, so we dump terabytes of data (TB/hour) onto the servers, but we still statistically miss the actually decisive events. If you're looking for something transient, like the split-second of dendrite nucleation that kills a battery, fixed-rate sampling is a massive information bottleneck. We’re basically filling up hard drives with dead data while missing the money shot.

We’re proposing a shift to Heuristic search in the temporal domain. We’ve introduced a metric called ESME (Entropy-Scaled Measurement Efficiency) based on Shannon’s information theory.

Instead of sampling at a constant frequency, we run a physics-based Digital Twin as a predictive surrogate. This AI Pilot calculates the expected informational value of every potential measurement in real-time. The hardware only triggers when the ESME score justifies the cost (beam damage, time, and data overhead). Essentially, while Active Learning tells you where to sample in a parameter space, this framework tells the hardware when to sample.

Questions for the Community:

1. Most AL research focuses on selecting the best what to label from a static pool. Has anyone here applied Information Theory gating to real-time hardware control in other domains (e.g., high-speed microscopy or robotics)?
2. We’re using physics-informed twins for the predictive heuristic. At what point does a purely model-agnostic surrogate (like a GNN or Transformer) become robust enough for split-second triggering in your experience? Is the "free lunch" of physics worth the computational overhead for real-time inference?
3. If we optimize purely for maximal entropy gain, do we risk an overfitting of the experimental design on rare failure events while losing the broader physical context of the steady state?

(Disclosure: I’m the lead author on this study. We’re looking for feedback on whether this ESME approach could be scaled to other high-cost experimental environments, and are still working on it before submission.)

P.S. If there are other researchers here using information-theoretic metrics for hardware gating (specifically in high-speed microscopy or SEM), I'd love to compare notes on ESME’s computational overhead.

Comment: This is genuinely interesting work. The "when to sample" framing is a useful reframe from standard AL and the synchrotron use case makes the cost tradeoffs concrete.

On your first question, event-driven cameras (neuromorphic sensors) are doing something conceptually similar in robotics and high-speed vision. They only fire pixels when intensity changes exceed a threshold, which is hardware-level information gating. Some adaptive MRI work also does acquisition scheduling based on expected information gain from k-space sampling. Different domain but same underlying principle of letting predicted value drive measurement timing.

The physics-informed versus model-agnostic question is where I'd be cautious. Our clients doing real-time inference for hardware control generally stick with physics-based surrogates for anything safety-critical or where failure modes matter. The issue with pure learned surrogates isn't average-case performance, it's that they fail unpredictably on distribution shift. Your dendrite nucleation event is almost by definition OOD relative to steady-state training data. A physics twin might be slower but at least it degrades gracefully when something weird happens. Transformers can confidently output garbage on novel inputs with no warning. For split-second triggering where a wrong decision means missing the money shot, I'd keep physics in the loop.

Your overfitting concern is valid and probably the biggest practical risk. If ESME aggressively downweights steady-state measurements you lose the baseline context needed to interpret the transient events. One approach would be a minimum sampling floor regardless of entropy score, basically forcing some "boring" measurements to maintain reference frames. Alternatively, penalize temporal gaps in the objective so it can't go too long without a sample even during predicted low-information periods.

The computational overhead question is empirical but sub-millisecond physics surrogates are definitely achievable with proper GPU implementation if your twin is reasonably scoped.

Comment: One thing to watch with entropy-based gating in real-time setups is that it can chase “interesting” measurements. Those which don’t actually move the system in a useful part of the state space. 

I find a small surrogate tracking local state deformation or trajectory sensitivity can stabilize things. I’ve seen it reduce rare-event overfitting without adding much overhead. Might be worth testing alongside your ESME setup.
