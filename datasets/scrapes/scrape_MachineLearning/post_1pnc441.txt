Hey all, since PapersWithCode has been down for a few months, we built an alternative tool called WizWand ([wizwand.com](https://www.wizwand.com)) to bring back a similar PwC style SOTA / benchmark + paper to code experience.

* You can browse SOTA benchmarks and code links just like PwC ( [wizwand.com/sota](https://www.wizwand.com/sota) ).
* We reimplemented the benchmark processing algorithm from ground up to aim for better accuracy. If anything looks off to you, please flag it.

In addition, we added a good paper notes organizer to make it handy for you:

* Annotate/highlight on PDFs directly in browser (select area or text)
* Your notes &amp; bookmarks are backend up and searchable

It’s completely free (🎉) as you may expect, and we’ll open source it soon. 

I hope this will be helpful to you. For feedbacks, please join the Discord/WhatsApp groups: [wizwand.com/contact](http://wizwand.com/contact)

Comment: Really like this, been missing papers with code. 

Would I be correct in presuming mAP on the object detection page is mAP 50-95? Not sure if you should specify that? Maybe it's a reasonable assumption that people will deduce it is mAP 50-95 since it's so common.

Comment: Thanks this is great. I have few questions:

In the audio domain for sota, why does classification include vision benchmarks?

How can we add a benchmark?

Comment: Your “playing games” and “robotics” sections are very bare. There’s certainly been more than 7 papers on continuous control (i.e. mujoco) and more than 5 for Atari. I think there’s research labs with more than 5 papers on Atari in a year.
