This year we received a total of 1343 submissions (after withdrawals and desk rejections) of which 338 were accepted as full papers, resulting in an acceptance rate of 25%. Another 205 submissions were accepted as extended abstracts for an overall (full papers + extended abstracts) acceptance rate of 40%.

They originally set Dec 22nd as the announcement date, but it seems like they decided to go earlier.

Comment: Got EA with a score of 6 and 8, and no major cons. The meta review simply had one line saying 
"Relevant for another AAMAS session"


Definitely disappointed with the results, but even more disappointed with the Meta Review, which gives no clarity

Comment: Rejected with 5,5,7. The main method complaints were incorrect interpretations, but of course no reviews updated after rebuttal  :-(
