This is a side project I've been working on for a few months.

I've designed a trait based ontology; 32 bits each representating a yes/no question, I've created trait specifications including examples and edge cases for each trait.

The user names and describes an entity (anything you can imagine) then submits it for classification. 

The entity plus trait description is passed in 32 separate LLM calls to assess the entity, and also provide standard embeddings.

I used some OpenRouter free models to populate what was originally 11,000+ entities. I've since reduced it, as I noticed I'd inadvertantly encoded 3,000 separate radioactive isotopes.

I've used wikidata for the bulk of the entities, but also created over 1000 curated entities to try and show the system is robust.

What we see in the plot is every entity in the semantic embedding location, derived through UMAP compression to 2D.

The colours are assigned by the trait based ontology - whichever of the layers has the most assigned traits sets the colour.

It shows interesting examples of where ontology and semantics agree and disagree.

I hope to develop the work to show that there is a secondary axis of meaning, which could be combined with language models, to provide novel or paradoxical insights.

The second image is the entity gallery - over 2500 images, quite a few auto generated at classification time via Nano Banana.

Happy to go into more detail if anyone is interested.
