Anyone care to share their experiences? Is the task doable/too much effort? Are the reviews helpful without reliable scores? Whats become your process to make a decision?

Just curious, any info appreciated

Comment: This is from the email they sent us:

What if I am not able to say how the reviewer may have changed their ratings? If you share a concern with the reviewer, please put yourself in their shoes when reading the author's response and judge for yourself whether the response addresses the concern.

I found this part pretty challenging. I think most of the ACs who I talked to felt similarly. We basically have to simulate the entire rebuttal process in our heads. I would guess that most folks just didn’t assume the reviewers would raise their scores.

Comment: I hope the AC rejects my paper lol. It's since been revised a bunch, making a much stronger submission to ICML.

But I also can't withdraw because... reasons.
