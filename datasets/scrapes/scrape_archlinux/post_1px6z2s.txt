Post Title: If the Steam client were also available as a 64-bit application on Linux, would there be any reason to continue using multilib?

I’m not sure which applications still require 32-bit dependencies. I’m running Hyprland and a very minimal setup, so I’m wondering whether I actually need 32-bit libraries at all.

Comment: I still play 32-bit games like F.E.A.R. (awesome game btw). I don't use Steam, I just buy them on DVD or from GOG and launch them on ES-DE. I don't even use Steam anymore. Your Steam games can get delisted at any time, and running Steam in the background can reduce performance in games.

Comment: Bunch of windows shit is still 32-bit, for me it came into play with old games and game launchers while running them through steam and proton so I keep them. And by old I mean a few years old.
