Kernel 6.18 is currently in test to replace linux. Will it replace linux-lts at the same time or only when 6.19 becomes linux?

Comment: It's usually the newest "longterm" version you see when you visit https://kernel.org/.

Comment: linux-lts will likely switch to 6.18 after the 10th patch release (6.18.10)

Comment: Since 6.18 is an LTS version, I believe the linux-lts package will also receive an update.

Because if you look at https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/linux-lts/-/commits/main, an update from kernel 6.6 to 6.12 was released in January 2025, even though version 6.6 will still be supported until December 2026 (https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html).
