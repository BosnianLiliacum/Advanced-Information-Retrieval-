I have always loved the impala's TUI and the idea it has come up with vim keybinding (customizable). But I prefer network manager over iwd, so I always had conflict. So, I forked the repo and changed the logic to use networkmanager with dbus and its in almost usable state. I mean at least I use it. If anyone wants to use impala but with Network Manager, give it a shot and (star) please. Also, not everything works, since I am still testing it.  
visit it here-&gt; [https://github.com/aashish-thapa/wlctl](https://github.com/aashish-thapa/wlctl)  
If anyone is expert in rust and want to contribute to this project please feel free to. There is lot of work to be done.

(The ulimate goal is the easy support to eduroam with CAT scripts.)

Comment: Nice program. To make it easier to install, I made AUR packages for it - [wlctl-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wlctl-git) and [wlctl-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/wlctl-bin).

Comment: I don't even know what impala is but I already like this. I've been using nmtui and it's abysmal. The developers apparently think of it as more of a debugging tool than something that actual humans can use.
