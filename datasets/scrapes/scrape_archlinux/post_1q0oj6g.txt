Hey everyone! I wanted to share a little project I've been working on called **histui**.

Don't get me wrong - **dunst is absolutely fantastic** (and plenty of other notification daemons!) and I have nothing but love for it. But I found myself wanting notification history via CLI, plus some extra theming flexibility, so I built histui as a complement to existing notification daemons, which I then ended up extending into a highly themeable notification daemon that worked the way I wanted it to.

It's probably got bugs, but I would love to see some people try it out and if people are really keen share some of your theme creations!

**What is it?**

* GTK4-based notification daemon for Wayland
* TUI-based CLI for browsing history
* History &amp; replay (SQLite database) with configurable retention
* Full CSS theming with hot reload

**Key features:**

* **Dunst compatibility** \- supports stacking, progress bars
* **Two modes**: Full daemon (exclusive dbus access) or monitor mode (runs alongside dunst/mako/etc to capture history only)
* **Rich content** \- clickable links, image previews, action buttons
* **Powerful search** \- query by app, urgency, time with JSON/dmenu output
* **Audio alerts** with per-urgency sounds

**Getting started (Arch):**

Bash

    yay -S histui-bin
    systemctl --user stop dunst  # if running, or mask it if using socket activation
    systemctl --user enable --now histuid

For monitor mode (alongside dunst):

Bash

    yay -S histui-bin
    systemctl --user enable --now histuid-monitor

Or of course for most of us using hyprland, just add exec-once=`histuid` to your hyprland config. You can access the TUI using `histui`

That's it! Check out the [documentation](https://jmylchreest.github.io/histui/) for other distros and configuration options. There's also a [demo video](https://youtu.be/kFPKzW_4zOg) (slightly older version) if you want to see it in action.

Would love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions!

I've got it that you vibe coded it, but please clean repo before showing it to the public
