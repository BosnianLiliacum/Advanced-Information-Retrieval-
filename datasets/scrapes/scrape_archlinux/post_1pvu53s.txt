Hi everyone!

I wanted to share a project I’ve been working on called **gopac**. It’s a TUI for Arch Linux package management built with Go and the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework.

I felt that existing tools were either too complex or lacked a certain "warmth," so I built gopac to be fast, functional, and visually pleasing (Gruvbox fans, this one is for you!).

# Features:

* Unified Search: Search both official repositories and the AUR simultaneously.
* Smart Sorting: Puts exact matches and installed packages at the top.
* Detailed Views: Quickly see maintainers, votes, versions, and dependencies.
* Automatic AUR Helper Detection: Works out of the box with `paru`, `yay`, `pikaur`, `aura`, and `trizen`.
* Built for Speed: Written in Go to keep things snappy.

# Installation

You can grab it from the AUR:

    yay -S gopac  # or paru -S gopac

Or build from source:

    git clone https://github.com/the-daonm/gopac.git
    cd gopac &amp;&amp; go build

# Support the Project

If you find this useful, I would really appreciate your support:

* Star the repo on GitHub: [https://github.com/the-daonm/gopac](https://github.com/the-daonm/gopac)
* Vote on AUR: [gopac](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gopac/) | [gopac-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gopac-bin/)

I’d love to hear your feedback or feature requests!

Comment: looks nice! i did notice that when using aura as the aur-helper it does not use the correct -A flag for AUR packages. apart from that it seems very nice so far. might be nice to have a hotkey overlay ala micro, or at least a button to see the hotkeys.
