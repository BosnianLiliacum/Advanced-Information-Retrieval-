Basically what the title says. Does yay -Syu do everything that pacman -Syu does, plus AUR packages?

Comment: Essentially, yea. You can even do just `yay` and that would do it too.

Comment: I don't want to come off as gatekeeping but I really don't understand why people would rather make a whole post and wait for people to respond for 1 sentence queries that can be answered with a single google search.

Comment: Here is another good tip, instead of pacman -Ss to search or yay -Ss to search just type yay and what you are searching for. It will return a numbered list of matches along with a description. Then you just pick the number.

    yay gnome extensions

    5 aur/gnome-shell-frippery 49.0-1 (+64 0.00) 
        Gnome Shell extensions to make Gnome 3 more like Gnome 2

Run just "yay", and watch what happens

Comment: I've aliased yay to "yay --aur" specifically so that it doesn't replace pacman. I like my AUR and official repos seperate.
