I installed Arch Linux recently and I use windows too. I play games like valorant in windows which requires secure boot on. But during boot up it will not load arch with secure boot on, because the keys are not signed. 

So is there any way to dual boot to Arch without turning off secure boot. 

I saw you can sign custom keys, but not sure if it may brick my BIOS or something.

Somebody please help if you have any solution..

Note : I have checked the docs but I'm not sure how to do it, i am new to arch...

Comment: If only there was a centralized resource for information about this distro. And if it were considered the one of the pinnacle’s of open-source documentation that would be even better.

Here’s payment for the ribbing: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot

Comment: You can add it but personally I just enable secure boot when I need to go into windows and disable when I go back into Arch

Comment: Did you do it ? I used sbctl to create and enroll my own keys and now I can dual boot with secure boot on and  play valorant in my laptop. I have the whole process and the commands saved somewhere. Let me know if you haven't done it yet. Till now I have only faced one problem. When I updated my bios , everything broke and grub wasn't working. So have a live Arch usb ready to solve it.

Comment: I just used Shim, which I found convenient and easy while also being relatively secure. REFInd also manages my keys.
