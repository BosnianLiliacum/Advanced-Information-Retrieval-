I am a new user and often forget what I changed in my system. Is there any package that allows me to automatically track changes and isn't too much complicated

Thanks

Comment: I just keep a simple text file in my home directory and jot down whatever I install or tweak - way easier than trying to remember later when something inevitably breaks

Comment: Git. If you want to go super hardcore you could start using Nix home manager

Comment: I have a pacman hook that updates a list of all explicitly installed packages everytime I install or remove something, so I always have an updated list of all installed packages that's saved in /etc.

Then i just backup /etc and my home directory regularly. Other than that, what are you actually changing?

Comment: I write everything I do into obsidian, kind of like a personal wiki; I include relevant documentation too so I understand why I did what I did. 

Also I have a pacman hook `/etc/pacman.d/hooks/10-packagelist.hook` which puts the current output of `pacman -Qqe` into a text file. Replace $user with your user name. 

    [Trigger]
    Operation = Install
    Operation = Remove
    Type = Package
    Target = *
    
    [Action]
    Description = Printing explicitly installed packages to ~/.config/arch/pkglist...
    When = PostTransaction
    Exec = /bin/sh -c 'runuser -u $user -- /usr/bin/pacman -Qqe &gt; /home/$user/.config/arch/pkglist'

Comment: Right now I'm saving configuration files and writing notes inside a folder and synchronizing that with GitHub.

I heard that there are better solutions like Chezmoi but haven't tried it yet.
