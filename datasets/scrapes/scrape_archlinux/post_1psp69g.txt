I read yesterday about this. From informant:

    NVIDIA 590 driver drops Pascal and lower support; main packages switch to Open Kernel Modules
    Sat, 20 Dec 2025 18:53:42 +0000
    
    With the update to driver version 590, the NVIDIA driver no longer supports Pascal
    (GTX 10xx) GPUs or older. We will replace the `nvidia` package with `nvidia-open`,
    `nvidia-dkms` with `nvidia-open-dkms`, and `nvidia-lts` with `nvidia-lts-open`.
    
    **Impact:** Updating the NVIDIA packages on systems with Pascal, Maxwell, or older
    cards will fail to load the driver, which may result in a broken graphical
    environment.
    
    **Intervention required for Pascal/older users:** Users with GTX 10xx series and
    older cards must switch to the legacy proprietary branch to maintain support:
    
     * Uninstall the official `nvidia`, `nvidia-lts`, or `nvidia-dkms` packages.
     * Install `nvidia-580xx-dkms` from the AUR
    
    Users with Turing (20xx and GTX 1650 series) and newer GPUs will automatically
    transition to the open kernel modules on upgrade and require no manual intervention.

I tried to update my system following this instructions but some issues arose. After some google searches I found this video:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCCVn9qglqY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCCVn9qglqY)

In the video details you can find instructions:

    sudo pacman -Rns nvidia nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils
    yay -S nvidia-580xx-dkms nvidia-580xx-utils lib32-nvidia-580xx-utils
    yay -S nvidia-580xx-settings
    yay -S opencl-nvidia-580xx lib32-opencl-nvidia-580xx

I have to also uninstall steam because dependencies but evething workes as spected after reinstalling. 

So, if you Mr. LinSwitch read this

Большое спасибо. Я пытался следовать инструкциям на ArchWiki, но ваши гораздо понятнее.

Привет из Мексики.

Cheers!

Comment: You didn't have to uninstall steam - you can forcefully remove packages without removing dependencies with `-Rdd` which would be appropriate for a use case such as this.

Comment: Don't need to uninstall anything, just install them in the proper order. Did it this morning, no issues. Basically, try to install everything, then only install whatever gives the "dependency failed" error, then the rest. I believe the order is:

*  lib32-nvidia-580xx-utils
*  nvidia-580xx-utils
*  the rest

Comment: I just ran pacman -Qss nvidia, and confirmed I had these three installed: nvidia, lib32-nvidia-utils, nvidia-utils

All I had to run was the following

    yay -Syu nvidia-580xx-dkms nvidia-580xx-utils lib32-nvidia-580xx-utils

Everything installed without a problem.
