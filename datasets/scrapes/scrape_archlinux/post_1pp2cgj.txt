I’m Egyptian, and back in the day there was a small sacred ritual.
Every Thursday, I’d rush home just to play Flash games for about two hours. That was a thing in Egypt until around 2019. Then Flash died, time sped up, and everything quietly fell apart. Funny how that works.

I started on Windows 7. It felt solid, predictable, almost friendly.
Then I moved to Windows 10, which was basically Windows 7 but louder, heavier, and constantly asking for updates like a needy coworker.

Eventually, I switched to Linux. And suddenly things made sense.

Linux isn’t just an OS. It’s a playground. A workshop. A place where creativity actually breathes.
Windows, on the other hand, feels like a locked apartment where you’re not allowed to move the furniture, repaint the walls, or ask questions. It had its era. That era is over.

Windows was comfort.
Linux is freedom.

Windows had its time, and it ran out of ideas.
The age of Linux has already started.

I use arch btw.

Comment: Hey it's me, your former coworker. I know we don't work together anymore, but will you please update me? Ever since you left, I haven't been updated, and I desperately need updates. Please?

Comment: I don't think it even really did have an era

Win7 was their last hurrah and it could not bulk-copy files properly. Garbage.

Win95 had a DE, but mostly it was a bloaty version of Windows 3.1 that messed up MS-DOS. I'm sure most people lost more time getting MS-DOS programs to work in spite of Win95 than the DE saved them.

And XP had such a horrible GUI that you used to need to buy a 3rd-party program.

Based on this small cross-section, I think Windows arrived in the eras of other things and generally made them worse whilst taking the credit.

Comment: You can still play many flash games on [flashpointarchive.org](http://flashpointarchive.org) and you don't need Flash installed. The website uses a Flash emulator, called Ruffle. So some games might not work properly, especially those that require online connectivity.
