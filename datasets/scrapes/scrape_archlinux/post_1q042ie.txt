I built a small terminal-based journaling tool in C++ called **jrnlc**.

It’s intentionally minimal: plain-text storage, no database, no cloud, atomic writes, and designed to compose nicely with Unix tools (`grep`, `less`, pipes, etc.).

Features include local vs global journals, backups, tag continuation, range &amp; time-based filtering, and optional ANSI colors via config file.

It’s available on the AUR (`yay -S jrnlc`).

Would love feedback from fellow Arch users—especially on UX or things that feel un-Arch-like 🙂

Comment:     jrnlc show *5 # displays first 5 entries
    jrnlc show 5* # displays last 5 entries

Isn't that a bit unintuitive? I'd read it as "skip (star) and then show 5" or "show 5 and than skip (star)" and get the opposite behaviour.

Comment: Not on Arch anymore but close enough (Void).
I like, it reminds me very much of my own first program (based off todo.txt in C so very similar). Manpage very nice and clean too!

It does remind a lot of that one in Python (jrnl). Imo, you could try add a little something to it to 'distinguish' it from other similar programs? (I'd imagine you wanna move to next project understandably)

+1 for including the -_- face. Takes me back to simpler times!

Comment: Hey everyone, thanks again for the feedback!  
I’ve updated `jrnlc` based on the suggestions:

* Replaced the `*` shorthand range notation with `:`\-based slicing, similar to Python.
* Added `--first` and `--last` options for easier access to the first/last entries.

Appreciate any further thoughts or testing on the new version!
