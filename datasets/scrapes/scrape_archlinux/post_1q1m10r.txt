Post Content:
I would like to know how to mount a drive to /run/media/{name}/ without needing a password authentication and to edit files inside and delete files and make files inside of the **nvme** drive whilst it also being accessible to steam and other launchers.

Comment: Install [udisks2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Udisks), enable/start the service and create a file /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/99-mount.rules or similar with this content:
     
    polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
      var YES = polkit.Result.YES;
      var permission = {
         // required for udisks2:
        "org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount": YES,
      };
      if (subject.isInGroup("storage")) {
        return permission[action.id];
      }
    });




Not verified, maybe theres an error but you should find the correct rules online or look here: https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie/wiki/Permissions

This allows any user in the group `storage`  to mount via udisk. Then you can use `udisksctl mount -b /dev/nvmeXnY` to mount the partition.

Comment: You could edit /etc/fstab OR you could mount the drive the location and change the owner with chown. (Both require sudo/root to edit the permissions and mount points.)
