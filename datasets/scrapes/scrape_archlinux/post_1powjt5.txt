Hi! ive been using arch casually for about a year now and today, after updating arch before going to bed yesterday, i cannot use the graphical interface.

broken:
 ly login screen
 DE / WM not loading at all / failing to load

arch itself is okay (i think?) i can use the command line alright and my files are still intact

from the logs, it seems to be a problem with the newest proprietary nvidia drivers but im not sure. arch can see my gpu but it fails to load drivers and freedesktop.home1.service 

any help would be greatly appreciated! 

specs
RTX 2060
amd ryzen 5 5600X
32gb ddr4 corsair ram
hyprland (wayland, arch)

Comment: You should read what pacman tells you during upgrades. ly had its service removed as they changed the way it functions. During the upgrade the following lines are printed:

    ly has switched its service from "ly.service" to a service template "ly@.service"
     ==&gt; If you had ly enabled as DisplayManager you need to reenable it:
     ==&gt;   sudo systemctl enable --now ly@tty1.service

Check if your wm is actually broken by manually launching it from the tty with `Hyprland`. Run it with logs enabled and post them here if it does not launch. You can just enable ly again using the command above if everything works

Comment: I don't get why these Arch people here always downvote posts. It's a valid question. It's so toxic no wonder why some people don't like to try Linux
