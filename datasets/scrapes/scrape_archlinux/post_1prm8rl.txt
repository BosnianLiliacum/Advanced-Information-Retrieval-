Post Content:
With the update to driver version 590, the NVIDIA driver no longer supports Pascal (GTX 10xx) GPUs or older. We will replace the `nvidia` package with `nvidia-open`, `nvidia-dkms` with `nvidia-open-dkms`, and `nvidia-lts` with `nvidia-lts-open`.

**Impact:** Updating the NVIDIA packages on systems with Pascal, Maxwell, or older cards will fail to load the driver, which may result in a broken graphical environment.

**Intervention required for Pascal/older users:** Users with GTX 10xx series and older cards must switch to the legacy proprietary branch to maintain support:

* Uninstall the official `nvidia`, `nvidia-lts`, or `nvidia-dkms` packages.
* Install `nvidia-580xx-dkms` from the AUR

Users with Turing (20xx and GTX 1650 series) and newer GPUs will automatically transition to the open kernel modules on upgrade and require no manual intervention.

Comment: I got the email notification but was there no way to make this more seamless. I think a lot of people are going to be hit by this.

Comment: Can someone ELI5, why is an AUR package recommended over just freezing updates to the current nvidia 580 driver series?

Edit: nevermind lol I got in my own head that this was gonna be a major headache to sort out, it was literally a piece of piss

Comment: Steam can't be installed anymore since it depends on `lib32-nvidia-utils`, which requires `nvidia-utils` which is no longer an option since the 580xx drivers install the 580xx utils package. Do we just wait for this to be amended? (For context I am running the linux zen kernel 6.18.1-zen1-2-zen)

Comment: It's a horrible decision to drop 580 series to AUR, Pascal cards are still very common.

Comment: Can we put `nvidia-580xx-dkms` back to \[extra\] repo ?
