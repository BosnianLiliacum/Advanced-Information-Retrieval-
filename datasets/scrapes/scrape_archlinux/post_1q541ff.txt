Comment: Did you check if your network interface is actually up? Try \`ip link\` and see if it shows as UP, might need to do \`ip link set \[interface\] up\` first

Comment: How are you handling DHCP? iwd can handle it itself, but you need to add a one line configuration for it. Otherwise you need dhcpd or something else.

Then, you would need a DNS Resolver too, in case you have not set it up. You can use systemd-resolved that is included in all Arch installations.

If you have also installed and enabled NetworkManager, iwctl will not work, as NetworkManager is expected to handle things.

Comment: Do you have a DHCP system installed, like dhcpcd?
