Hey there! I want to use the RT kernel on my system for low latency audio and stuff. I installed the linux-rt package on the repos, but the latest version of that is 6.14 (which for me is enough to \*not\* use it). Is there any way to patch the kernel so I get 6.18 with RT? Or is there just no point in using it, that being the reason why it is not updated to 6.18?

It seems to be just maintainer time, unless there is a more technical blocker for packaging the 6.18 realtime patchset on Arch. 6.18 is currently in the extra-testing repo though and I guess would be out some time soon.

I personally do not know about audio use-case, but Pipewire, Jack and specific applications can run realtime too, and this is even recommended for Pipewire as an optional dependency.

Perhaps the realtime kernel is not that useful? And it comes with drawbacks too; probably higher power usage, less throughput. All to get better latency, which may not even be noticeable. But perhaps it is noticeable; as I mentioned I have no experience with it.

Then, using an older kernel version is no big deal neither. If you think you want `linux-rt`, you may go with 6.14. It is currently less than 1 month old. An older kernel version would mainly be a concern for security, and that does not apply to every user in a serious way. I personally go without a `pacman -Syu` for more than a month sometimes.

To add, it seems 6.12 is the "stable version" for the kernel realtime patchset right now. I guess it comes delayed, and the maintainer may be deciding when to package a new `linux-rt` depending on the state of the development version. (Just my speculation.)

Comment: The realtime kernel has been an option in the mainline kernel since 6.12. This means that you can compile your own kernel using that option and get the feature:

I recommend using make menuconfig to edit the config and searching for CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT to find and enable it.
