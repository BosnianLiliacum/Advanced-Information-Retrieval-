Hello,
Today, I wanted to connect my HP printer to my Arch Linux installation, but there isn’t a clear wiki for this. I found the setup process quite complicated, so I decided to write a short guide to help others. Note that your printer should already be connected to the Wi-Fi network.

**First, install the following utilities:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S cups system-config-printer hplip python-pyqt5
```

- **cups**: service for connecting a printer
- **hplip**: drivers for HP printers
- **system-config-printer**: graphical tool for managing printers
- **python-pyqt5** (optional): dependency for the HP utilities’ graphical interface

**Next, enable the CUPS service:**

```bash
systemctl enable --now cups.service
```

Or

```bash
systemctl enable --now cups.socket
```

**Turn on your printer**, then run in the terminal:

```bash
system-config-printer
```

Click **"Add"**, then **"Network Printer"**, select your printer, and choose **"Appsocket/HP JetDirect"**. Try printing a test page—it should work!



**Installing Plugins (Optional)**

Some features, like scanning, require additional plugins. To install them, use the AUR package **hplip-plugin**:

```bash
yay -S hplip-plugin
```
or
```bash
paru -S hplip-plugin
```

After installation, you’ll be able to scan and use other features.



I hope this guide helps! Feel free to share your tips, as this is my first tutorial. :)

Comment: There is also the option to enable the cups.socket instead of the service. That way cups only starts if a program needs it. I orefer that personally.

You can just add a printer through a web browser. You get much more control of printer options doing it through https://localhost:631

Comment: Appreciate this guide, I had trouble figuring out why my printer wasn't working after following [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS), but I just needed hplip-plugin
