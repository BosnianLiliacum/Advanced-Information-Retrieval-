just got that as a reason for it being mark as out of date... I know you generally don't mark git packages out of date, but this reason is odd to mark it as so.

pkg in question...: [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/labfyre-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/labfyre-git)

Comment: In my experience, people will mark AUR packages as out of date for any reason, without commenting or leaving any explanation. It is what it is, don't take it personally.

Comment: Normally people use either comments or send patches via mail. But it is generally a good idea to set provides for a git package, so if another package depends on this package the user can choose which one to pull (-bin, -git, ..)

Comment: Might be because you pushed `pkgver=0`, which seems odd when looking at it...

Typically you just push whatever version is returned by the `pkgver`function when pushing an update to PKGBUILD, i.e., the expected version would be: `pkgver=0.9.2.r135.g8103a01` at the time of writing.

Edit: My bad, interpreted the "issue" incorrectly, would assume that should've been a comment rather than a reason to mark it as out-of-date, yeah...
