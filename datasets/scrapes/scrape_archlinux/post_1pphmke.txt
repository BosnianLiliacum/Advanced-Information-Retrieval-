# Problem has been fixed as of linux 6.18.3-arch1-1 update

Laptop: 83MC (Lenovo Slim 7 14ILL10)

Hey all, over the past many kernel updates I have found myself constantly having to downgrade to fix my audio. When updating to newer versions of the kernel, my speaker disappears and I am left with dummy output. Downgrading to an older kernel fixes it.

I was hoping 6.18.1.arch1-2 would fix this issue, but it did not. I found myself, yet again, downgrading to 6.17.7.arch1-2.

Online, people often list solutions involving packages they were missing. I have found that I am not missing any packages that I need (that I know of).

Anyone else finding themselves in a similar situation? Is there any manual solution, or will I have to wait for another update?

Furthermore, is this issue even being addressed? The way I articulate the problem isn't ideal, so I haven't really found anything addressing this issue or any indication that this is being worked on.

I really hope this isn't a problem that I'm uniquely experiencing, or one that will just echo endlessly.

I'm not an expert by any means, so please bear with me.
