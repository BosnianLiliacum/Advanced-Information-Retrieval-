Connected my phone via USB to Dolphin but image thumbnails don't show. Other USB drives work fine. Arch + KDE Plasma 6 kio-extras and libmtp installed Files show up, just no previews Is this fixable or just how MTP works?

Edit: In Dolphin, go to Settings → Interface → Previews and check the Remote Storage Size Limit
