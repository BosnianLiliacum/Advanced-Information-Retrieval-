What do you guys do to update your system if it's been a while. Occasionally I need to leave town for 1-2 months and leave my arch desktop behind. When I return the updates can break and be a bit of a headache. Any advice to mitigate these types of problems?

Comment: 1. I check the Arch news: [https://archlinux.org/news/](https://archlinux.org/news/)
2. Create a snapshot/backup of my system: [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System\_backup](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System_backup)
3. I run `pacman -Syu` while taking into account anything the news told me to do.
4. I set aside some time to rebuild AUR packages. If you use a helper, you could skip this by running something like `yay -Syu` in step 3
5. Reboot because uptime is overrated.

pacman -Syu, reboot, pray to Arch gods.

If shit happens, bust out ole trusty Arch USB stick to repair whatever is wrong.

Comment: It's been a minute since I let any of my arches go 2 months, but I scan the homepage for manual interventions and just yolo pacman -Syu


If you have lots of breakages, you should figure out why. As a one-time self-inflicted victim of explicitly installing dependencies I tend to start there...

Comment: A problem I've found is keyrings if you leave updating too long. An easy workaround is:

```sh
pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring &amp;&amp; pacman -Su
```

Comment: 1-2 months isn't that long. I thought everyone used Informant
