I’ve been working on a project that lets you view and control a live Wayland desktop **entirely inside a terminal**, rendered using Unicode (braille / block / ASCII).

**What it does:**

* Real-time Wayland capture → Unicode rendering
* Aims to run in *any* terminal
* TCP streaming with LZ4 compression
* Full bidirectional input (keyboard + mouse)
* Audio streaming via PipeWire
* Optional CUDA-accelerated rendering on the server
* Full color, zoom, rotation, adjustable quality/detail levels

Open a terminal, connect, and your desktop just shows up.  
Keybinds let you switch renderers, zoom, rotate, and tweak quality live.
