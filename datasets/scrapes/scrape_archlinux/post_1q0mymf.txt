Hi r/archlinux, I'm a newbie that has only ever installed Ubuntu on an old laptop I used as a server. I'd like to learn more about Linux/Arch and I find I learn best by tinkering with things and figuring stuff out through trial and error. The problem is I don't want to risk my main drive, so I was wondering if buying an external drive or going the virtual machine route would be best?

Using another drive or trying it in a VM is an option too, yes.

Comment: yeah go through the tutorial on the arch website and do it on a toy drive first just to see what its like and then do it on your main PC. It's not hard really. Just a bunch of terminal commands, and there are util scripts out there that will do it for you, but as a noob you should do it manually first just to see what its like

Comment: Easier is to just read a book on the topic.  Unix has basic file system layout.  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix\_filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem)

The above is quite terse, so i suggest reading on Unix System Admin.

Once you read above.  Head to Archlinux wiki on installation section.

Comment: Anyone who thinks that a manual installation of Arch had never installed SLS (Softlanding Linux System).

1. Go buy three boxes of floppies.
2. Spend several hours downloading the distro. (Or several days, if you were on dialup.)
3. Unzip each archive and write it to floppy. (Remember, you were likely running MS-DOS, so one task at a time!)
4. Spend the next couple of hours "doin' the Floppy Shuffle".
5. Go through the kernel configurator, enabling the various devices in your system.
6. Go do something else for the next hour or so while the computer compiles the kernel.
7. Reboot, and find that you specified the wrong video driver. Download the right one and recompile.
8. Reboot, and realize you forgot to add the drivers for your network card. Download and recompile. Congratulations! You have a text-only Linux system! 
9. Spend the next few days in your XF86Config file, figuring out the dot clocks for your particular video card and monitor combination.

Congratulations! You have a working X Windows Linux system! 

FYI: The above is what promoted Ian Murdock to create Debian.
