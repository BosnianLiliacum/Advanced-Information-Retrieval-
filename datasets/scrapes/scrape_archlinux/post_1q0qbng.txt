Post Content:
I'm currently using Linux Mint with Cinnamon. My complaints are all software-side and the OS is great. However, I've been looking more into Arch. I'd love a simpler OS where I have more control, I've also heard a lot about KDE Plasma and I love the customization. I've learnt a lot in my time with Mint and I have no problem with CLIs so I doubt installing and using Arch will be a hassle.

As the title says, what would be your advice? And what's your reason for using Arch? (No, social status is not a valid reason.)

Comment: My reason for using arch?  First rolling release that doesn't require me to compile everything (Tumbleweed and binary packages for Gentoo were later inventions)

Advice? RTFM, RTFM and RTFM.  Almost all the issues you will encounter in setting things up are in the wiki.

Comment: Arch installs nothing for you. It's all yours. Excellent for a daily driver. Install once.

Comment: I use it because it's what I'm accustomed to and for the readily available support.  Every time I have questions, I know where to find reliable answers, and it doesn't involve having to ask an llm or beg for others to do my research on reddit.  I've used other distros, some extensively.  Day to day, it's no different from them.  It's really not until I have a problem that Arch really shines.

Comment: The way Arch defines simplicity. 

Simplicity
Arch Linux defines simplicity as without unnecessary additions or modifications. It ships software as released by the original developers—upstream—with minimal distribution-specific downstream changes. Patches not accepted by upstream are avoided, and Arch's downstream patches consist almost entirely of backported bug fixes that are obsoleted by the project's next release.

Though I do think Fedora also aligns somewhat close to this if you want more recent packages with less setup. 

But arch is the best.

Comment: Minimalist, and rolling releases are my reason. Advice: be okay dealing with some instability. Go read the docs for stuff
