So I've been daily driving Arch for about a year now. Work as a software engineer and honestly Hyprland has become my happy place for ricing.

Anyway, I kept getting frustrated with app launchers. Like Rofi and Wofi are great dont get me wrong, tried Walker from Omarchy but I literaly just want to type a few letters, hit enter, app opens. Thats it. I dont need web search or calculator or any of that stuff - just want it stupid fast and out of my way.

Couldn't find exactly what I wanted so I figured why not just build it myself?

Called it Yeet because... well you yeet apps open I guess? Naming things is hard lmao

The gist:

* substring matching first, falls back to fuzzy if it doesnt find anything
* keyboard driven (alt+1-9 to quick launch)
* config is just TOML and you can theme it with CSS
* single binary, pretty minimal depedencies

Also submitted my first ever AUR package which feels like a right of passage at this point?? Kinda nervous about that tbh

feel free to roast me and flame my arse

Comment: sorry back up there a second. why are app launchers being worked on? do apps not launch themselves? do people take up Linux without knowing how to install or link programs into /bin directories? in what kind of use-case does this require a further layer of configuration? I mean menus are arguable enough as being redundant cruft, but don't people's DEs already provide keyboard shortcuts?

I admit I make some assumptions: people who want this sort of stuff will have a DE, and every DE I've seen lets you make keyboard shortcuts. (but I've not used Hyprland to be sure)
