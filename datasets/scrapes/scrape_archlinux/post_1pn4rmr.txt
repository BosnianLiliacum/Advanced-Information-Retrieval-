I'm looking for the best way to add a clock on a Wayland system without the use of a bar.  
I use Hyprland and have btop open on a special workspace to pull up whenever I need to check my computer's performance, and I was thinking I could put a clock there as well, but I don't know what program would be best.  I'm also open to the idea of having the time shown over the wallpaper, but only as an extra and not to be used as my primary way to tell the time.

Also, to anyone else here who doesn't use a bar, what do you do for the time, and other info?

-n 1 time should do it. 

(Hopefully this gives you a chuckle and you don't just think I'm being a smart ass. 😊)

# tiny popup with exact date/time
bind = SUPER, T, exec, notify-send "$(date '+%H:%M:%S %a %y-%m-%d')"
```
