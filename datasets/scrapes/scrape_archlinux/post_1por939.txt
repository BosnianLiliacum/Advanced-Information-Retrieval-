Actually I didn't break Arch. What happened was that I updated the system and something broke between **`ly`** login manager and **`systemd`**/**`systemctl`**, which disabled ly and dumped me straight to TTY. It was an easy fix (enable/disable/reboot).

Honestly, I was both afraid &amp; excited about my first break.

Simultaneously, I also had a break in paru... but that wasn't my fault.

Comment: One of the reasons it is important to read the pacman output when you run it. It would have warned you this was going to happen.

From [this commit](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/ly/-/commit/ab28787b159f846dab2f4363bda598a396254c54), see
[ly.install](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/ly/-/blob/ab28787b159f846dab2f4363bda598a396254c54/ly.install):

    #!/bin/bash
    
    # arg 1: the new package version
    # arg 2: the old package version
    post_upgrade() {
      if (( "$(vercmp "$2" 1.2.0)" &lt;= 0 )); then
        echo '==&gt; ly has switched its service from "ly.service" to a service template "ly@.service"'
        echo '==&gt; If you had ly enabled as DisplayManager you need to reenable it:'
        echo '==&gt;   sudo systemctl enable --now ly@tty1.service'
      fi
      :
    }

Comment: Had this happen to me, too! I was too busy to troubleshoot it but I figured it had to do with Ly. I will do a systemctl enable disable plus reboot tmr to see if it helps. Thanks man!
