Have had my install for a few years now, and all is good. Though, I’ve noticed newer tools being added to the installation process: Limine, Dracut, etc. 

How many of you have adopted new tech, and how many are used to the old ways?

Interesting to see what your rocking on your system, and what made you give it a try.

Comment: After a few years I did a new installation a couple weeks ago.

I tried to use all the new things there are to use, although not sure if all of them are "bleeding edge", probably not:

- BTRFS, everything encrypted with LUKS2.
- Removed Windows 11, that's super bleeding edge lol
- Secure boot enabled.
- LUKS2 unlock  with TPM2.
- sytemd-boot (definetly bot bleeding edge, but it's new for me after using reFINd

Aside from that.. I update almost daily, so always at the latest versions of everything.

Comment: Idk honestly how to answer your question, but I'll say I simply add what I need and remove what I don't, update once a week, and enjoy playing games or whatever.

Comment: Unified Kernel Images + GPT partition automounting is a pretty nice setup

If you're on a single disk system you can have an empty `/etc/fstab` everything just automatically loads

It all works with LUKS too.

EDIT: This also means you can cut down your kernel cmdline to `quiet rw` if you have no additional requirements
