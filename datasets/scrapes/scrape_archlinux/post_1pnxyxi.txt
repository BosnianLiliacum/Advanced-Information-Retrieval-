I built a small, keyboard-first package management workflow for Arch using rofi + fzf.



It’s not meant to replace pacman or reinvent anything — just a fast, minimal way

to browse, install, and remove packages when I’m already living in the keyboard

  
Demo: [https://youtu.be/nhDmGUmdV0I](https://youtu.be/nhDmGUmdV0I)

Repo: https://github.com/benevolentshrine/pacboof


Key points:

\- Native pacman + AUR support

\- fzf-powered search with package info

\- Curated menus (IDEs, languages, TUI tools)

\- Structured error handling + logs

\- Minimal, opinionated workflow



Heavily inspired by the Omarchy installer menu.



Sharing for feedback from folks who prefer keyboard-centric workflows.

Comment: I use a personal short `bash` script that works as a universal package manager for the most used distributions, which has an integration with `fzf` to install, uninstall, get information, purge, and so on. Just source it in your `.bashrc` em use `pm i/install`, `pm u/uninstall`, `pm U/update`, `pm ls/list`, and so on... It also comes equipped with a completion script (`bash-completion` is not required [I hate that]).
