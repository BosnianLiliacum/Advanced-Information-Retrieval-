I’ve been solely using Linux for a while now but I’d just use grub since that’s what my previous distro used (fedora). However I’ve heard that grub is kind of deprecated these days in favor of systemd-boot, should i just use that or one of the other options listed on the wiki like rEFInd or Limine? I do not plan to dual boot ever but i do plan on using btrfs snapshots of some kind (either snapper or timeshift, still researching this). Anyone got any opinions or tips?

Comment: I matters very little. If you want minimalism, systemd-boot covers 98% of use cases on modern PCs, and can even dual boot.

Comment: I would recommend *no* bootloader. [UKI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_kernel_image). Your entire ESP (EFI System Partition) can be just one file; BOOTX64.EFI, the initramfs+kernel that is directly booted, taking the bootloader step out of the way. It is just a one line setup in mkinitcpio to configure this.

But if you want the ability to manage btrfs snapshots from the bootloader, then this is not a good option. However, I would think you do not need the snapshots often. And you can manage them from the archiso USB or somewhere else if you ever have issues or an unbootable system.

In any case, I **personally** do not recommend btrfs anyway... Snapshots are **not backups**, they are just a convenient way to travel in time, and I do not understand why many people think they need it.

Comment: if you're only ever going to use arch and no dual booting, systemd is fastest, but idk how good support is if any for snapshot listing.

limine is really nice though and does
