Been on Manjaro for a couple years. From there went back to Debian. Wanted to come back to Arch. Just didn't wanna do the install process. First time took me all day and several installs to get it right. Well today I decided to use archinstall script. Was up and running with in minutes. Thank you to who ever built that script

Comment: If you’re using arch install, you’re not a real arch user. Is what I would have said if I were extremely annoying and condescending, but no, people value their time, and I love arch install script ! Welcome !

Comment: Once you know what you are doing, arch install is great if your scenario is handled by it.

Next time I do a  full install I may use it.

Comment: Btw, I know you're likely a pro user and everything, but just in the 1% you're not, beware archinstall does not install a firewall for you, so you'd better install one.
