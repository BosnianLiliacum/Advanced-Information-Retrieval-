I bought a new laptop for the first time in 10 years last week. Never really needed one because I always used my work Macbook for personal things too. I got a Thinkpad because I knew I wanted to use Linux. I immediately wiped Windows and installed Arch. I spent a LOT of the past week trying different desktops and window managers, installing things, and configuring everything.

Today, I decided to uninstall a package I had just installed, but I used the forbidden `-Rsc` flag. It kept going for a while and I stopped it, but it was too late. Naturally I wanted to see what packages I have left, so I ran `sudo pacman -Qe` and encountered:
```
Unknown command: sudo
```

Brother. What. The. Fuck. I though I misspelled it. But I didn't. I felt a pit in my stomach. I realized I don't need sudo, so tried it without and I saw:
```
Unknown command: pacman
```

Houston, we have a problem. But wait, I did the dumbest thing next: Reboot. I don't know hat I expected. There was no desktop manager, no TTY, nothing. Just a lovely message saying:
```
ERROR: Root device mounted successfully, but /sbin/init does not exist.
Bailing out, you are on your own now. Good luck.
```

Long story short, using an archiso USB and following along [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/s4vy2a/root_device_mounted_successfully_but_sbininit/), 2 hours later everything is back to normal with no data lost.

I regret nothing. This was the most fun I had in the past month.

Comment: It's always great when you have a disaster and can fix it. Great learning experience. Lucky for you no actual data was involved. It always makes me sad when when I read about people trying to dual boot and wipe out all of their data from the Windows partitions. Stuff like documents, pictures and videos... always sucks to lose that stuff.

Comment: Did you not check the list of packages to be removed before confirming the command?
