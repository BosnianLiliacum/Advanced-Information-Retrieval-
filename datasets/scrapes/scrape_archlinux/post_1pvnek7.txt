If you go to https://status.archlinux.org/ it says that the main website is currently down due to DDoS attacks and that only IPv6 is available but where do I get said IPv6? I tried `dig AAAA archlinux.org` and also found one on Cloudflare but neither of them are working. It just says "This site can't be reached"

EDIT:
The IP I got from dig: https://[2a01:4f9:c012:16e3::1]/
And I actually checked it's the same as Cloudflare's so it must be the right one and yet it doesn't work for me
