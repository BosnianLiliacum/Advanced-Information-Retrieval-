Comment: Since yt-dlp supports QuickJS, and this has comparable performance, I wonder if this can be embedded without the need for an external runtime.

Comment: I'm getting some slight implications that this was built with porting to microcontrollers in mind.. like, it's not ready for that out of box seemingly, but the absurdly low resource usage and the specific mention of compiling to ARM Thumb-2 assembly and referring to the compiled binary as residing in a "ROM" seems to imply this is part of the thinking..
