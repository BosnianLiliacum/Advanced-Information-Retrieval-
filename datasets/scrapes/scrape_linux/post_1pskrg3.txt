We all have some takes that the rest of the Linux community would look down on and in my case also Unix people. I am kind of curious what the hot takes are and of course sort for controversial.

I'll start: syscalls are far better than using the filesystem and the functionality that is now only in the fs should be made accessible through syscalls.
