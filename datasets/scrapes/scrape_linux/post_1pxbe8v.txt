Comment: In a hundred years, Linus Torvalds will be seen as a hero in the age of monopolistic late stage predatory capitalism. Every current business exec with an ego complex, will be seen as what they are, in time.

Comment: I learned a lot about him this year as I had the opportunity to write a paper on him. He is not only a massive influence on tech but also relatable, as even though he has worked on it over the years, he is not a people person. He just wants to pet his cat and have good version control. He is the best of us haha
