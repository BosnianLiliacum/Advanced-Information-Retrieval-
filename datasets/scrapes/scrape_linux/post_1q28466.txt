Comment: It's not really that useful because pretty much everything that needs to display a logo uses a userspace boot splash implementation (usually Plymouth on Linux desktops) anyways, but the code cleanups that came along with it are welcome to see.

Comment: Kernel boot logo? I don't remember seeing it once. Do you need to add some flag in grub to make it appear?
