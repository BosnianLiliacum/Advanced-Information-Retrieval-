Comment: Been on arch since 2008. Every personal computer of mine has ran it since then and I havent broken a system (even minorly, like live USB -&gt; chroot -&gt; regen init) in ~5+ years


...and all of my servers run Debian, because I'm rational and not driven by hype.

Comment: Another “people need it, people build it, people use it” situation - I personally don’t need this edition, but I like the spirit.
