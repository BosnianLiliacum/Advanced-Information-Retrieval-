just got my first pull request merged into mainline linux (v6.19 cycle). i will be riding this high for at least a week. i didn't contribute much of meaningful value, but it still feels good! i feel like a real linux girl now.

My first couple of commits weren't very interesting either, but I'm upstreaming my first driver now!
