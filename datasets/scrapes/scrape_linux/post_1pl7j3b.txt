Comment: Not very surprising. MS has been a big contributor to the Linux kernel and their cloud platform is highly dependent on a Linux based infrastructure.

Comment: At last count I think 100% of the top500 list uses Linux.

Ubuntu happens to be the most popular Linux distro, the other big one used in data centers is RHEL/Fedora, and SUSE is also popular especially in Europe.

Comment: [El Capitan](https://www.top500.org/system/180307/) the fastest on the top500 list also runs Linux. Special version of RHEL (Red Hat) for HPC.
