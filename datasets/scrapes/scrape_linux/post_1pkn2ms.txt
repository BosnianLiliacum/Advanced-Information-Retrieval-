Comment: As gitea shares history and code with gogs, i wonder if it's vulnurable too. Looking for a PutContents in the github repo, i guess not. 

And is gogs unmaintained, or why is an actual, exploited, not theoretical exploit unpatched half a year later ?

Comment: I used to use Gigs. I quite liked it, but it simply just missed some features that Gitea had, so I had to migrate.
