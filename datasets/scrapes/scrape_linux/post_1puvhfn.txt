I've been using Linux for over 20 years, mostly Gentoo, now nixOS, promoting opensource and Linux to my students (with some success I can say) and now it is time to give a little something back to the community:

eilmeldung is a TUI RSS reader based on the awesome newsflash library and supports many RSS providers. It has vim-like kev bindings, is configurable, comes with a powerful query language and bulk operations.

This proiect is not Al (vibe-)coded! And it is sad that I even have to say this. Still, as a full disclosure, with this proiect I wanted to finc
out if and how LLMs can be used to learn a new
programming language; rust in this case. Each line of code was written by myself; it contains all my beginner mistakes. warts and all. More on this at the bottom of the GitHub page:

Let me know what you think!

Comment: It's great, i've been using it with freshrss, but i feel like the name is a bit hard to read, write and remember, especially for a CLI app, aside from that i love it.
