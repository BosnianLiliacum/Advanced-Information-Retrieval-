Comment: Well it was guaranteed to happen eventually. And I'm not saying that because I'm a rust hater, I'm saying it because as long as something is even remotely probable, it's a matter of when it'll happen.

Comment: "This first CVE for Rust code in the Linux kernel pertains to the Android Binder rewrite in Rust. There is a race condition that can occur due to some noted unsafe Rust code. That code can lead to memory corruption of the previous/next pointers and in turn cause a crash."
