We are testing Linux as the primary operating system, with open source alternatives for stuff like office, on peoples work computers in government agencies. Traffic control gets to be our first test subject.

This is gonna be put in the hands of somewhat tech-illiterate people. Definetly a gonna be messy at first.

Maybe it will go well. Maybe our traffic lights are randomly purple soon, we will see.

Comment: If what they need to do is write letters and reports, use spreadsheets,  create presentations, use email and browse the web there will be zero problems. Any Linux distro with LibreOffice and Firefox can do the job, and any computer user can click on icons to launch the programs.
