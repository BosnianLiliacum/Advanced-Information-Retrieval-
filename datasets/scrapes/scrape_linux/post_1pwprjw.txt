Comment: 2 years is plenty of time to rewrite stuff, I am shocked it wasnt done sooner. Though nothing is going to stop them from hosting another offsite git repo in mainland. They arent going to let their repo die as easily.

Comment: I think this is the primary source: https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2025/12/2025-12-18-ffmpeg.md Just linking it here for convenience as I think more people other than me have a problem with links to X which is a problematic network in general and harmful to users.

Comment: Good. Fuck any company that takes and doesn't return the code, or follow the license of the code.
