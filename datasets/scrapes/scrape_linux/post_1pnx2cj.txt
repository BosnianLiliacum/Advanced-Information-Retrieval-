Comment: I live in Thailand, I would like to make a donation via a debit/credit card but this option is not available in my country (tried already ). I am sorry that PayPal is not an option for me due to some reasons. Hopefully this limitation will be sorted out for the future.

Comment: A donation to KDE has become part of my yearly budget. 

The project has been doing solid work that has finally allowed me to fully convert to Linux 100% on all my computers over the last few years. In my eyes, they've been good stewards and also support various other projects that I am interested in supporting. 

I've also been more intentional in "Buying" my software. Keeping a list of my "Must have tools" and ensuring that I send some money to the developers too at least once per year. 

This is especially true for the smaller tools I use, because those usually rely on one or 2 developers, and do not have the swarm of volunteers to pick up the mantle if the main devs decide to step out. 

If you find something good and useful, you should pay for it, and I think KDE is setting a good example of how to do that well for their organizations needs.
