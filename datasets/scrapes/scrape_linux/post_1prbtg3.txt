Comment: so err what actually uses this, out of curiosity?

A quick google just showed the debian page and a wikipedia article but it isn't clear what is currently using this in anger. Searching on the "shopping" tab just tries to send me to pages for Nintendo Switches (which I believe are arm64), and AMD Threadripper retailers.

Is there a niche part of the market using this (like MIPS to an extent)?

Comment: This is big news.

For countries who no longer want to depend on the US given the current shanenigans this is huge.

Cue the fearmongering of chinese backdoors and spyware. It may be something that state actors may need to worry about, but not the average joe.

I'm looking forward to consumer level devices which will increase the competition in the microprocessor space, both for capabilities as well as price.

Unfortunately, Some countries like Canada have blocked Chinese technology just to appease the US.

Comment: From a purely academic side of things, LoongArch is an interesting ISA.  It's a fork of MIPS that has some RISC-V added in as well as custom instructions.
