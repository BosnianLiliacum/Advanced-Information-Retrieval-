Replaced the original MT7925 WiFi card on my ProArt PX13 with an old Intel WiFi 5 card I had laying around (8260)... needless to say, has been miles better.

The MediaTek card would take FOREVER to connect to a network (if it even did... I often needed to restart the network service), and the link speed would be terrible (11mb/s). By contrast, the old card I installed connected instantly with an 866mb/s link and great speeds (200mb/s, as opposed to not-even-connecting)

Are most MediaTek drivers this terrible on Linux? I swapped the card completely because I didn't want to go through the headache of finding/configuring proper drivers. What WiFi 7 cards play well with Linux that you all would recommend (for a more permanent solution)?

Comment: Qualcomm cards are the best for Wifi 7. MediaTek is terrible on any platform.
