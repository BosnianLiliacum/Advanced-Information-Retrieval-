today i installed sm64ex and my dad helped me make start.bash executable. When i launched the game he was surprised about opengl on linux so i got curious. Since when does linux support opengl?
also, play sm64 however you can. its an amazing 3d platformer
UPDATE: I asked my dad a few minutes ago about it, and it turns out he mixed up opengl and directx.

Comment: Curious about why he got surprised by it since OpenGL was for a very long time basically the only option on Linux

Comment: I remember fighting to get OpenGL and glx extensions working in X11 on my Matrox Mystique card back in 2000 or so.
