Comment: By 2000, Linux was already pretty well established and it would not have made any sense for Linus to take a job with Apple.  He already had a pretty good job with Transmeta where he could work on things that interested him, including Linux.  I'm guessing he also wasn't short of money since he'd been given stock options in Red Hat and VA Linux.

Edit: Couple of you might be taking this comment too seriously.  It's a joke.  It ain't that deep.

Comment: Microsoft offered Jobs $150 million to bail out Apple in the early 90’s.
All he had to do was “knife the baby”, as MS put it. The baby was QuickTime.
