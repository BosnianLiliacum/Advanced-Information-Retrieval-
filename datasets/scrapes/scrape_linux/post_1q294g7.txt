Hello everyone, happy new year!.

Just pushed a new game to my [UEFI Games repo](https://github.com/mycroftsnm/UEFIGame), basically you have to survive a *procedurally generated* descent to continue booting linux, but if you touch a wall, you lose and the computer turns off.  ([demo video](https://github.com/mycroftsnm/UEFIGame?tab=readme-ov-file#demo-videos))

  
EDIT: [New Release](https://github.com/mycroftsnm/UEFIGame/releases/tag/1.4.0) with 2 more games!  (one being contributed!)

Comment: OMGGGGGGG I needed to figure out this for my game. It runs as a standalone BIOS boot kernel and I wanted to make it with UEFI too: https://github.com/arf20/arfminesweeper

Friend bought me 'Return to Monkey Island' for a birthday present recently. Massive disappointment, loved the first two.
