Comment: Is the benefit here (compared to Wine) that it translates to Vulkan instead of OpenGL?

Comment: I remember having and reporting issues in Rayman Origins' rendering like 5 years ago when D9VK was not integrated into DXVK. Time flies, now there is D7VK and DX6 support is in the works, amazing.

The spice must flow, compatibility must grow!

Comment: Still need to investigate certain DX6/7/8 games with these newer tools. It might be experimental, but maybe now is the time. I also need to look into 86Box/PCBox more.
