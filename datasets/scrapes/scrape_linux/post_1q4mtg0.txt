Comment: This sort of role is one of the rare ones that need to be paid even if the majority of Debian is unpaid this isn't a fun job but is pretty critical.

Comment: With how passionate the Debian community is to their distro and its long-standing history of being the 2nd oldest Linux distro still being maintained, I hope that we see people fill this void with data protection on Debian.

This will definitely have a chain effect, as many distros (such as Linux Mint Debian Edition) are based on Debian.

Comment: Not a surprise. The designated GDPR officer can be held personally criminally responsible for breaches of the GDPR. Few people would take on that level of responsibility without significant remuneration.
