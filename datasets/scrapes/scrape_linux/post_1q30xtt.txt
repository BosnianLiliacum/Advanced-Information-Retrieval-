Comment: &gt; The email interface is 100% open. Anyone can edit any bug in any way just by sending a suitably crafted email to the control address [3]. If a 4chan script kiddie would want to screw up the entire Debian bug repository, they could do so fairly easily. 

Shameful.

Comment: Maybe i am being overly optimistic. but i bet if someone would start a kickstarter for modernizing the debian bug tracker it would get fully funded.

Comment: Most debian web pages in general could use a touch up or a complete replacement.

I'm not asking for javascript up the ass.

But take for example Fedora's use of Kitty as a front end to mailing lists.

Comment: Whatever new interface may arise, I hope it doesn't require javascript

Comment: I mean honestly, steps 1 to 3 (developing a better client) would basically solve the issue, and like he says, is doable by one person. I'm a little surprised no one has simply written a better UI for reportbug by now.
