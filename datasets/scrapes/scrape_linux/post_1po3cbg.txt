Comment: Copying and pasting my comment here:


This is the House of Lords, ie the chamber that has fuck all power. What's more, none of the "lords" (they're not real lords any more) that have proposed these amendments are even of the governing party. 

If the government had wanted these amendments in the bill, it would have put them in there in the first place. This is just a little group of self-righteous cunts looking to push an agenda by proposing ridiculous amendments.

Edit: Quick and dirty explainer on how it all works: bills start in the House of Commons and are normally put forward by the government. They get worked on for a while in various committees until everyone's happy, and then they're sent to the Lords for review. The Lords can propose amendments but the gov't (which sits in the Commons btw) is free to ignore them. The Lords can also block a bill if they're really against it but they can only do this three times I believe before it automatically goes through, and it's extremely rare anyway for them to do this, like a once per generation sort of thing.

Comment: Nothing surprising here.


I mean, it is the UK after all, the exact same country that arrests individuals for innocent social media posts.
