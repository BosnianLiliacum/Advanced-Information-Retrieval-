Coming from Windows, SSMS was everywhere in my workflow. Even for simple tasks like running a few queries or updating rows, I had to launch this gigabyte-heavy behemoth that took ages to start.

When I switched to Linux, SSMS wasn't an option anymore. The popular solution was VS Code's SQL extension. But launching an Electron-based code editor just to execute SQL queries felt... wrong.

I'd recently discovered the beauty of Terminal UIs - fast, keyboard-driven, and efficient. I tried existing SQL TUIs like lazysql and harlequin, but they didn't click with me the way tools like lazygit did. Nothing felt as intuitive or had that "just works" experience.

So I built Sqlit - a lightweight, keyboard-driven SQL TUI inspired by lazygit's workflow.

What it does:

* Connect to databases and browse tables/views/schemas
* Run queries with syntax highlighting and autocomplete
* Vim-style keybindings and intuitive navigation
* Multiple themes (Tokyo Night, Nord, etc. Syncs up if you use Omarchy)
* Supports SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MariaDB, Oracle, DuckDB, CockroachDB, ClickHouse, Snowflake, and more

Sqlit deliberately avoids bloat. It's not trying to be a full-featured database IDE with performance graphs and schema designers. It focuses on doing one thing well: making it fast and enjoyable to connect, browse, and query your databases without the overhead of GUI applications.

Comment: I did "pipx inject sqlit-tui mysql-connector-python" but it still shows no "pymysql" module found. 

It also says press \^i for help. What is it? Ctrl+i? If so, it behaves same as Tab

Comment: Have you looked at Harlequin ? Not that it beats building something yourself but is also a great db tui app
