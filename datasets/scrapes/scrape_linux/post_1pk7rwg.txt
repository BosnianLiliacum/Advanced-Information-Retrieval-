Comment: The AI side of Canva and Affinity makes me suspect BUT I will definitely try to support them if they make a native Linux port. 

Maybe they could inspire Blackmagic Design to polish up the Linux version of Resolve. It’s pretty good already, but there are some quirks that make it hard to recommend.
