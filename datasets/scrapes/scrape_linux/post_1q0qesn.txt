Post Title: Not an endorsement, but Ableton making a hackable Linux-based portable DAW and even outright showcasing it as a use case for the RPi CM wasn't exactly on my bingo card

You don't even need to crowbar your way into it, you can [add an ssh key directly via the web UI of the device](https://imgur.com/a/c2MOCK8), root into it, and install community-supplied software (may void the warranty).

As noted, not an endorsement, just appreciation; I don't own the device and can't comment on how well it works or whether it is worth the $449 price tag. It's just cool to see this outside of squarely open products where modularity, open software, etc. is the entire selling point.

Comment: &gt; may void the warranty

It's been ruled (in the US at least) that software modification cannot void warranty unless it objectively results in hardware damage (which in itself is nearly impossible to prove).

"Installing software" can barely be considered software modification as it is lol

Comment: That's dope! Literally just switched to Linux for music production using Reaper. No complaints so far! I do have to see if some of my plugins will install out of curiosity, but I really plan on switching to open source plugins completely at some point.

Very happy that big companies like Ableton and Valve are taking Linux seriously in challenging computing tasks like DSP and 3D Graphics respectively.

Comment: It's always worth to promote companies that treat user with respect. I have no need for it but it's nice to see some companies do make products that are YOUR upon purchase.
