I noticed how many people are starting to change their preferences from Windows to Linux due to latest news about Microsoft's ending of Windows 10 support. An how Windows 11 is bad. I'm also impressed how Gabe Newell is developing so fast Linux Gaming. Steam Deck is great portable console. I used virtual machines to try various versions of Linux. I liked Ubuntu and Manjaro.

So, I believe Linux's situation may soon improve well. I remember times when anime culture in Russia was heavily marginalized and felt so alien for ordinary citizens. Now Russian streaming services are gaining more profits from Japanese animation, especially due to western sanctions. It became mainstream here. So, I bet Linux may get such attention in future. I'm impressed how Linux community improved very well and made a great work. I heard that Linux could now run videogames at more FPS than Windows.

If this so, maybe it's time for Windows to leave throne for a retirement. After all, back in times, old Mac Os was the #1 operating system back in 80s and 90s.

Comment: It depends on who you ask, in my programmer bubble it has definitely become an acceptable and mainstream option. My colleagues mainly use Mac or Linux, and there is that one stubborn Windows user.

Comment: 3% on steam so far.

Once it is like 25% on the steam hardware, then it will be mainstream for gamers.

Comment: In regular life, no. People have been saying this is the year for desktop Linux as long as Linux has been a thing. 

Maybe in techy groups and stuff, but your average person doesn’t actually care what windows is like, as long as it runs Google Chrome.

I hear a lot of people talking about how windows is just a big surveillance platform now. Not really realizing most people willingly give up there info anyways. So it’s really not a big deal to the average person using Google Chrome for Facebook
