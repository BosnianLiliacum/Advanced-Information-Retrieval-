Bear with me - it's not as far fetched as it may appear:

Given current US foreign policy, and "possible" issues going forward with the US/European relationship, is now the time to consider standardising on Linux as THE defacto European desktop OS?  Is it a strategically wise move to leave European business IT under the control of Windows, which (as we have seen) can be rendered largely (or totally) inoperative with an update?

Note:  this is NOT an anti-US post - thinking purely along the lines of business continuity here should things turn sour(er).

Comment: Yes, full stop.

I think we need to start seeing a general office workflow (OS, Email Client, Office Suite, Communication and Project Management tools) as infrastructure. Digital Roadways so to speak.

It's a no brainer that you do not let an American company own the literal roads or sewage system in a European city. Why do you let them own the methods by which you do any meaningful work?

Infrastructure in computing should be Open Source. It's insulated via legal framework from hostile corporate or government takeovers. It can be forked when necessary to protect against bad actors and provides the local IT departments greater flexibility to control for downtime.

Comment: I think the entire world should now consider standardizing Linux.

It's objectively a more secure, private, and better performing OS.

Why else is it used on all the world's 500 fastest supercomputers and the predominant OS for servers?
