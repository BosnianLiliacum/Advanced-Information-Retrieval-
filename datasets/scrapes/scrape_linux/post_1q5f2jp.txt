After I switched to linux recently, I  started to like to get my things done in terminal so wanted a simple way to keep notes without switching to a GUI app.
So I built a terminal-based sticky notes TUI focused on keyboard-first workflows and a clean interface.

**Key Features:**

* **Keyboard-Centric:** Navigate, add, edit, and delete notes without touching the mouse.
* **Color Coding:** 9 different color themes to organize thoughts visually (Hotkeys 1-9).
* **Priorities &amp; Pinning:** Set priorities (Trivial to Critical) and pin important notes to the top.
* **Search Modal:** Filter notes instantly by title, content, or tags.
* **Auto-Save:** Data is persistent and saved to your OS's standard data directory (XDG on Linux).
* **Modern Tooling:** The project is managed with `uv` for fast and reliable dependency management.

**Installation:**

I included a helper script for Linux users to install it globally to `/usr/local/bin`:

Bash

    git clone https://github.com/dengo07/textual-sticky-notes-tui
    cd sticky-notes-tui
    sudo ./manage.sh install

Now you can just type `stickynotes` from anywhere.

I’d appreciate feedback from Linux and terminal users, especially around usability and whether this fits a real daily workflow.

Comment: It looks good, but what's wrong with text files? Plus, it seems to be just like a GUI.
