Post Content:
So instead of just using **htop** like a normal person, I decided to write my own tiny terminal process manager in **C** using **ncurses**.

why ?

\- because I wanted to

What it does right now:

\- shows running processes

\- updates in real time

\- basic navigation (yes, vim keys)

Code is here if you want to roast it:

Yes, I know this already exists. No, that will not stop me.

Comment: Looks nice. If you can think of any value-adds htop doesn't have it might even gain popularity.
