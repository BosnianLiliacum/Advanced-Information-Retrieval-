Comment: Your output shown here doesn't include TCP/UDP. That's usually pretty important.

Comment: Why are you using so many external tools to extract and format information that is directly readable from files in /proc and /sys? Just read the data directly and format it.

Comment: My only comment (just from the screenshot) is on the parameter/argument syntax.  For example with `oports proc:tor`, why not the more typical double-dash or single dash syntax `oports --proc tor` and (if shortened) `oports -p tor`?

Is there an advantage to the `:` separated syntax? Maybe I’m not familiar with the use cases or the other apps that are similar to this that use it.


Edit: I see you have a `-h` already. Also, I wonder if ipv6 IP compatibility were added, it might be slightly easier to read/parse (not that it’s a huge deal).
