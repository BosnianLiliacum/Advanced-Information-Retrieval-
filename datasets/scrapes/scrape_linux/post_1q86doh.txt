I noticed beginners get super overwhelmed trying to find and install apps via the terminal or software centers, so i made this tool to put everything in one place

besides bulk installing, it's good for discovery - go thru the list, find new apps, and install them in one single command

Currently supports most major distros **Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu** based systems, handling all the `pacman` / `dnf` / `apt` logic for you. Just added **flatpak** support as well, so you can toggle sources to install proprietary stuff (discord, spotify, etc) via flathub if your native repos don't have them.

It’s completely open source and runs in your browser. I’d love to hear what you think!

Comment: TIL the declarative part of NixOS is that you have to declare to everyone that you use NixOS on any tangentially-related thread.

Comment: A feature where we can save/store the apps installed metadata so that I can reinstall all my apps again when needed for e.g. after fresh installing linux os or installing same apps in another system without going into list again and choose.
