After trying Linux for the first time, I do not think i can go back to Windows ever again. There's absolutely no bloat, full customization, and it can run on anything. I actually have EndeavorOS running on my shitty chromebook from 2017! And total control... I love having total control over every little thing. Linux is awesome.

Comment: is this your first time using Linux? and how long have you been using EndeavourOS?

I believe that rolling release is the way to go for desktop Linux, but novice users tend to have more difficulties in these scenarios.

thank you for sharing your experience.
