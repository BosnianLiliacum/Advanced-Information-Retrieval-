Merry Christmas guys!

Two days ago I released v1.0.0 of my Mouse Tiler for KDE Plasma 6.

It is probably the fastest and easiest to use manual tiler for KDE. No need to remember dozens of keyboard shortcuts. Just drag your window a few pixels and it's where you want it to be.

You can use one of two mouse adapted tilers (or both). The Popup Grid tiler lets you quickly place your window by moving the window a few pixels. The Overlay tiler is a classical full screen overlay that lets you place your window into one tile, or span multiple tiles. Define your own layouts or use some of the many predefined ones.

Key features:

* Two mouse tiling modes - Popup Grid and Overlay (use one or both)
* Follow system theme or use one of pre-defined color themes
* Highly customizable, from tile size to grid position (over 20 settings)

To install the script you can:

1. Open `System Settings` \&gt; `Window Management` \&gt; `KWin Scripts`.
2. Click the `Get New...` in upper right corner.
3. Search for `Mouse Tiler` and click `Install.`
4. Enable `Mouse Tiler` in previous menu.
5. Click `Apply` to enable it.

Enjoy and Merry Christmas!

Comment: Looks interesting.  I'm usually a diehard tiling WM fan, but I'll have to see about giving this a try.
