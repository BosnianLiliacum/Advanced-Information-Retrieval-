Post Content:
```
$ f=/etc/sudoers.d/99-insults; echo "Defaults insults" | sudo tee "$f" &amp;&amp; sudo chmod 440 "$f" &amp;&amp; sudo visudo --check
Defaults insults
/etc/sudoers: parsed OK
/etc/sudoers.d/99-insults: parsed OK
```

Then, get abused:
```
$ sudo true
[sudo] password for tom:
Listen, broccoli brains, I don't have time to listen to this trash.
[sudo] password for tom:
Sorry about this, I know it's a bit silly.
[sudo] password for tom:
Pauses for audience applause, not a sausage
```

Comment: That's cool. It's always nice to see software that has a bit of personality in it. As opposed to the Microsoft-esque approach of uniform corporate beige. IMO we lost something after Windows XP when everyone started trying to make software as professional and "sleek" as possible.
