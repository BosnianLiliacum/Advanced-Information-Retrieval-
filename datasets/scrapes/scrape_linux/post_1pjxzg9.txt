Comment: Install a distro with MATE, LXDE, or LXQt, and you can have a modern distro, that still looks old. Hell, MATE still looks like the screenshot here, which is basically just GNOME 2 so 2002-2010 era.

But, no, I don't really care about trying "old" distros. I tried most of them in 00s and into early 10s.

Old Linux, old windows, old MacOS.

Comment: It's funny how I prefer gnome 2 over KDE 4 a million times. But now I'd pick Plasma over Gnome 3 a million times.

Gnome 2 hits nostalgia right in the feels when I was installing my first centos's

Comment: It's not strange really, there's a lot of great graphic design hidden away in old versions of any OS. Sometimes there's more than just graphic design to find, too.

This is why people wax poetic about Windows Classic and Windows Aero, for example. It's not nostalgia, it's good sense that's been callously discarded over the years. And now we see various developers finally realizing that the flat design era really sucked, of course.
