I’ve been in IT for over 3 years, and I’ve never really dabbled in Linux but have followed this page and a few others for a while. 

I got my hands on an old potato (HP), and thought it’d be a good time to try Linux. 

Was actually amazed at the speed, had windows on it before and it was a slow experience, whereas Ubuntu has ran incredible. 

Didn’t expect to like Linux, but seriously considering doing it for my main - major major upgrade. 

Bit stuck on what is worth learning (I work security), but sure I’ll pick it up over time. 

Great community

Same. Switched a couple of years ago due to the abomination that is Windows 11 and I have not looked back. It hasn't always been smooth sailing, but it's far better than being annoyed by Microsoft daily.

Comment: Linux feels so magical with how it breathes new life into old hardware.

Put it on newer hardware and you realize how light, efficient, and powerful the OS really is.

No wonder it's used on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers!

Comment: Don't be afraid of the command line. if you're interested in security, you're going to want to be familiar with the command line because when you remote to a machine, that's all you have most of the time.

Comment: If you think Ubuntu is fast, wait until you try Puppy or antiX or TinyCore.
