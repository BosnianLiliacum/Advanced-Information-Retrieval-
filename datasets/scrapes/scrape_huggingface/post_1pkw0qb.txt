i'm going through the Hugging Face agents course which makes a lot of use of the **Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct** model. Today I started getting health check errors on that model so I let the InferenceClientModel choose the default model which is **Qwen/Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking**. However, this model is not quite as adept at code generation and gives completely different output than shown in the course's notebook.

What are my options here? Is there some other model I should be using when using a CodeAgent?

Comment: Silly me. You'd think I'd learn to just ask an AI this question. I ended up going with **Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct** which seems to be working nicely
