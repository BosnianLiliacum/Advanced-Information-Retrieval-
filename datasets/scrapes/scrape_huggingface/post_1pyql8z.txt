Hi everyone,

I’m trying to get a **clear and realistic answer** about NSFW / uncensored / roleplay-oriented models on Hugging Face —  
**specifically models that are marked as “Inference Available” and actually usable across** ***all*** **Hugging Face serverless inference providers.**

To be very explicit, by this I mean models that:

* Are explicitly marked **“Inference Available”** on their Hugging Face model page
* Can be called via **Hugging Face Inference Providers**
* Use **serverless inference** (no self-hosted endpoints, no local GGUF)
* And work across the **entire provider layer**, not just a single backend



# The issue I keep running into

There are many community models labeled as:

* *uncensored*
* *low-alignment*
* *roleplay-focused*

However, in practice:

* Many of these models are **NOT marked as “Inference Available”**
* Or they are marked as available, but:
   * return 404 when called via inference APIs
   * are “not supported by this provider”
   * or are silently moderated / filtered at the provider layer
* Some models may work on **one specific provider**, but **fail on others**, which breaks real production usage

So in reality, *“uncensored” + “Inference Available” + “all serverless inference providers”* seems to be an almost empty intersection.



# My questions

1. **Are there** ***any*** **models that:**
   * are genuinely low-alignment / uncensored (especially for roleplay or character chat),
   * are explicitly marked **Inference Available**,
   * and work across **all Hugging Face serverless inference providers**?
2. If the realistic answer is “no”:
   * Is it fair to say that **HF serverless inference is fundamentally incompatible with NSFW / RP-heavy use cases** in 2025?
3. Architecturally:
   * Is moderation enforced **upstream at the inference provider or router layer**, regardless of model alignment?
   * Or are there known exceptions where providers remain permissive *when accessed through HF’s router*?



# What I’m not asking for

* Not asking for illegal content
* Not asking for local GGUF
* Not asking for self-hosted inference endpoints

I’m trying to understand the **actual practical boundary** of HF serverless inference —  
and whether “uncensored models” on HF are effectively **local-only unless you run your own infrastructure**.

Any recent, hands-on insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
