Hi everyone 👋  
I’m preparing for a **Data Scientist take-home assessment** involving **vector-based similarity scores for job titles** (LLM embeddings).

I’ve already completed my answers, but I’d really appreciate **feedback from practicing Data Scientists**

id,job\_title1,job\_title2,score

0,development team leader,development team leader,100

198,infirmier praticien,infirmière praticienne,89

269,IBM SALES PROFESSIONAL,PROFISSIONAL DU VENDAS DA IBM,6

| 1) Based on the available scores, what do you think of the model performance? How would you evaluate it?

2) Based on the available scores, what do you think of the model’s gender bias and fairness compliance?

3) Do you think a keyword-based matching would outperform a vector-based approach on this data? Why (not)?

4) If you had access to the model, would you generate any other data to expand the evaluation?

If you’ve interviewed candidates for DS roles or worked on **NLP / embedding / similarity models**, I’d love to hear:

* What follow-ups you’d ask
* Common pitfalls candidates miss
* What would make an answer stand out as *senior / production-ready*

Thanks in advance—happy to share more details if helpful! 🙏
