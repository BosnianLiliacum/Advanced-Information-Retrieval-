Comment: This is impressive — especially making a **14B I2V model accessible without signup**. Hosting friction is honestly one of the biggest blockers for people who just want to *try* these models.

A couple of things I’m curious about:

* How are you handling **VRAM optimization / batching** for concurrent users at 14B scale?
* Any noticeable trade-offs between the **Lightning LoRA** speedups and temporal consistency in longer clips?
* Have you tested prompts that push camera motion vs. subject motion separately?

Really appreciate people who put in the effort to make cutting-edge models usable, not just publishable. 👍
