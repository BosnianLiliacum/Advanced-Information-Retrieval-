I am looking for some kind of NLI model, where the specific task is given some information about a law, does it support predictions about the law's effects. What is the SOTA out there now? I do not want to just use something like GPT-4 because I want it to be non-stochastic and able to run locally.

Comment: What do mean by non-stochastic?

It sounds like you want a Turing machine, not an LLM. 

The basics problem you describe is quite doable. I would look at prompting and RAG support first, though. NotebookLM+Deep Research may also be suitable.
