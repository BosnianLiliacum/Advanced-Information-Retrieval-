Comment: Gemini's answer fixed this issue for me. Here it is:

The reason your downloads fail midway with Free Download Manager (FDM) and cannot be automatically resumed is due to **Signed URLs with short expiration times**.

When you click "Download" on the Hugging Face website, the server generates a secure, temporary link specifically for you. This link is valid for a short time (often 10–60 minutes).\[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQE7q0Zl6zaGoQBNo2xHu8scZKiZlG9IdbIrE8JTClUiGHID-uIMQln3d4ssdgxZHcoHlgUOam5w4jubH4Mm4i8TuhwK9TVHTO-VqMWOcNaF3dX9yBLfe3sOn0s_FoAyQNLa6e8w-JpmNClqmeGcGWs6lJ4zd1PqZO2DLR9A9LJLABGKKU-29YLX2HBp6MHBwQ%3D%3D)\]

* **The Fix:** You need a tool that knows how to "refresh" the authentication token automatically when the link expires.

Here is the solution to get reliable, uninterrupted overnight downloads.

# The Solution: Use the Hugging Face CLI

The official CLI is essentially a dedicated "Download Manager" for Hugging Face. It handles expired links, auto-resumes, and checks file integrity automatically....
