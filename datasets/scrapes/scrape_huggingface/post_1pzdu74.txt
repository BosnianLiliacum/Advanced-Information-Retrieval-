after downloading the questions from the given url, i'm unable to fetch the correct images from the url. i consulted it's openapi.json, asked various ai chatbots, but nothing gave me a good response. when i enter the url in the browser, alll it says is 

    {"detail":"No file path associated with task_id {task_id."}

where i just copy pasted the task id  
the url was [https://agents-course-unit4-scoring.hf.space/files/{task\_id}](https://agents-course-unit4-scoring.hf.space/files/{task_id}) i don't know what to do anymore

Comment: Contact the course author or your professor -- there might be an error in the URL you were given

Comment: The task id in your url is a placeholder. Do you have the task id? Try replacing {task_id} with the actual task id.
