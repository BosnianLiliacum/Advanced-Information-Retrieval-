Hi, I am a pro user but need more GPU time than the 25 minutes. I gave tried duplicating the space I want to use but whenever I try to switch the hardware I get an error. 

I'm totally new, complete beginner to this. What's an easy way to duplicate a space that's on zeroGPU and be able to pay to use it myself? Thank you for any help or guidance.
