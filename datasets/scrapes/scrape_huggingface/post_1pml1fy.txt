Post Content:
I fine-tuned YOLOv8 on a pothole dataset using Nebius Cloud and uploaded the model to HuggingFace.

Sharing my results and training metrics here, i would like to get some feedback or improvement suggestions.

For future reference also, the model was used here in inference:

The repository documents how the training, inference and mobile app were done and integrated
