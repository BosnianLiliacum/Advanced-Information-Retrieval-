Hey everyone! 👋 I built a tool called **hf-grass**. It generates a GitHub-style contribution heatmap (grass) based on your Hugging Face activity.

It produces an SVG that you can easily embed in your GitHub README. It also comes with a GitHub Actions workflow, so it updates automatically every day!

**Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas! 🎄✨**
