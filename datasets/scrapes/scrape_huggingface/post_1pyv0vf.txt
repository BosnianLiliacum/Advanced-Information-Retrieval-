I received my **Reachy Mini**, and instead of sticking with the usual “SSH-terminal juggling” workflow, I wanted to see if I could configure something that feels closer to modern day IDE workflow using VS Code as a base.

The goal for this IDE:  
 \- Remote development directly on Reachy Mini  
 \- Run programs inside Reachy Mini’s App Python environement   
 \- Full Python debugging support  
 \- Primitive, but realtime performance monitoring 

I ended up combining VS Code with [Remote SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh), [SSH monitor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=femtowork.ssh-remote-monitor) and installation of [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) in Remote Extension Host to enable debugging. Full step-by-step guide availlable [here](https://tobrun.github.io/blog/reachy-mini-ide/)

Comment: nice! How are you finding Reachy mini, still experimenting? Did you got for the lite or wireless version, how did you decide?
