Hi everyone!

I’m looking for the current state-of-the-art in **local** Text-to-Speech specifically for the **Polish language**. My goal is to generate long-form audiobooks.

I’ve been out of the loop for a few months and I'm wondering what's the best choice right now that balances quality and hardware requirements.

**Key requirements:**

1. **Polish support:** Must handle Polish phonetics, accents, and "sz/cz" sounds naturally without a heavy "americanized" accent.
2. **Long-form stability:** Needs to handle long chapters without hallucinating, losing the voice profile, or becoming robotic over time.
3. **Local hosting:** Privacy and cost are key, so I’m looking for something I can run on my own hardware (RTX 3090/4090).

**Models I'm considering:**

* **XTTS v2:** Is it still the king for Polish or has it been surpassed?
* **Fish Speech (v1.5/2.0):** How is the Polish quality compared to English?
* **Kokoro-82M:** I heard it's fast, but does it have a solid Polish voice yet?
* **F5-TTS / VibeVoice:** Are these viable for full-length books?

What is your experience with Polish prosody (intonation) in these models? Are there any specific fine-tunes or "community voices" for Polish that you would recommend?

Thanks in advance!
