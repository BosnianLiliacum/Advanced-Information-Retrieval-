Hi everyone,

I am sharing **TraceML**, a small open-source tool I’ve been building to make **PyTorch / Hugging Face training runs more observable while they’re running.**

The focus is on things I kept missing when training or fine-tuning models:

* **Layer-wise memory usage** (activations + gradients)
* **Layer-wise timing** (forward &amp; backward)
* **Step timers** for user-defined sections (data loading, forward, backward, optimizer, etc.)

It is designed to be always-on and lightweight, not a heavy profiler you run once and turn off.  
Tested on **NVIDIA T4**, showing **low  overhead** in real training runs.

Current status:

* Single-GPU training supported
* CLI / notebook friendly output
* Minimal setup (hooks + timers, no big config)

What I am working on next:

* DDP / multi-GPU support
* Testing on larger GPUs &amp; faster machines (where Python/GIL effects show up)
* A simple offline viewer for saved trace logs

I would really appreciate:

* ⭐ **Stars** if this looks useful
* Feedback on **what metrics or views matter most** during HF training
* Suggestions from people debugging **OOMs, slow steps, or unexpected memory spikes**

Happy to iterate based on community feedback. Thanks!
