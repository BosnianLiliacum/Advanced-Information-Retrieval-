Hey y'all, I want to generate images locally with [https://huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo), but it doesn't  have a gguf file. I see that Draw Things and Diffusion Bee are available, but they're Mac based.

How can I get something like [https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo) running locally on Windows?

I can get Text models running fine on Ollama, Chatbox or Open-WebUI, but I don't know where to start with this kind of model.

Btw it has GGUF support in the gguf-support branch. Just choose the model from the dropdown.

Comment: Open the hugging face spaces link you sent: [https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image-Turbo)

Then at the top right click the 3 dots. Then go to run locally. Theres instructions to run that space locally using docker or python
