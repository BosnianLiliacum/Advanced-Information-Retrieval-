Hey everyone 👋

I’m sharing **Genesis-152M-Instruct**, an **experimental small language model** built to explore how *recent architectural ideas interact* when combined in a single model — especially under **tight data constraints**.



This is **research-oriented**, not a production model or SOTA claim.





🔍 **Why this might be interesting**



Most recent architectures (GLA, FoX, TTT, µP, sparsity) are tested **in isolation** and usually at **large scale**.

I wanted to answer a simpler question:



*How much can architecture compensate for data at \~150M parameters?*



Genesis combines several **ICLR 2024–2025 ideas** into one model and evaluates the result.





⚡ **TL;DR**

• **152M parameters**

• Trained on **\~2B tokens** (vs \~2T for SmolLM2)

• Hybrid **GLA + FoX attention**

• **Test-Time Training (TTT)** during inference

• **Selective Activation (sparse FFN)**

• **µP-scaled training**

• Fully open-source (Apache 2.0)

📦 pip install genesis-llm





📊 **Benchmarks (LightEval, Apple MPS)**



ARC-Easy     → 44.0%   (random: 25%)

BoolQ        → 56.3%   (random: 50%)

HellaSwag    → 30.2%   (random: 25%)

SciQ         → 46.8%   (random: 25%)

Winogrande   → 49.1%   (random: 50%)



**Important context:**

SmolLM2-135M was trained on **\~2 trillion tokens**.

Genesis uses **\~2 billion tokens** — so this is not a fair head-to-head, but an exploration of **architecture vs data scaling**.





🧠 **Architecture Overview**



**Hybrid Attention (Qwen3-Next inspired)**



**Layer** **%** **Complexity** **Role**

Gated DeltaNet (GLA) 75% O(n) Long-range efficiency

FoX (Forgetting Attention) 25% O(n²) Precise retrieval



GLA uses:

• Delta rule memory updates

• Mamba-style gating

• L2-normalized Q/K

• Short convolutions



FoX adds:

• Softmax attention

• Data-dependent forget gate

• Output gating





**Test-Time Training (TTT)**



Instead of frozen inference, Genesis can **adapt online**:

• Dual-form TTT (parallel gradients)

• Low-rank updates (rank=4)

• Learnable inner learning rate



Paper: *Learning to (Learn at Test Time)* (MIT, ICML 2024)





**Selective Activation (Sparse FFN)**



SwiGLU FFNs with **top-k activation masking** (85% kept).

Currently acts as **regularization** — real speedups need sparse kernels.





**µP Scaling + Zero-Centered RMSNorm**

• Hyperparameters tuned on small proxy

• Transferred via µP rules

• Zero-centered RMSNorm for stable scaling





⚠️ **Limitations (honest)**

• Small training corpus (2B tokens)

• TTT adds \~5–10% inference overhead

• No RLHF

• Experimental, not production-ready

I’d really appreciate feedback — especially from folks working on **linear attention**, **hybrid architectures**, or **test-time adaptation**.
