Hello,

I’m doing image-to-video and text-to-video generation, and I’m trying to measure system performance across different models. I’m using an RTX 5090, and in some cases the video generation takes a long time. I’m definitely using pipe.to("cuda"), and I offload to CPU when necessary. My code is in Python and uses Hugging Face APIs.

One thing I’ve noticed is that, in some cases, ComfyUI seems to generate faster than my Python script while using the same model. That’s another reason I want a precise way to track performance. I tried nvidia-smi, but it doesn’t give me much detail. I also started looking into PyTorch CUDA APIs, but I haven’t gotten very far yet.

Considering the reliability lack in the generation of video I am even wondering if gpu really is used a lot of time, or if cpu offloading is taking place.

Thanks in advance!
