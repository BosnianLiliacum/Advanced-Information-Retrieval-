Hi everyone,

I’m Leander. I decided to open-source my entire self under a CC0 license.

If you are waiting on your results or are curious about the file structures, file sizes, or quality of the raw data , you are welcome to explore my files. I’ve uploaded the massive `.cram` file (\~100GB) and the `.vcf.gz` files.
