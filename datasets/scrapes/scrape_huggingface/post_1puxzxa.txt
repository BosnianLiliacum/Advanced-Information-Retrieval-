I'm obviously doing something wrong using huggingface.co.  I cannot seem to find the stuff im searching for.  For example, today i read about a new model on NanoGPT ([https://nano-gpt.com/media?mode=image&amp;model=flux-2-turbo](https://nano-gpt.com/media?mode=image&amp;model=flux-2-turbo)), and I wanted to check it out to see if I can run it locally etc.  so I went to [huggingface.co](http://huggingface.co), and in the search bar at top entered flux.2\[turbo\]  got nothing remotely like it -- tried other combinations.  NADA!

so what am I doing wrong -- I suspect its me, not the site, i think im just being dumb.

Also -- people mention being able to find LORA etc on HF, and im not having any luck -- can someone please help me out?
