I don't understand the reachy mini robot.

I get that it's more for. Learning but the robot is stationary and it doesn't have anything to interact with the world (like a hand or claw or something). 

So it kind of defeats the purpose of being a robot. Yes it has moveable parts but just "display" ones. I don't think it's posible to do anything compelling with it? 

What am I missing here?
