Comment: Try Tor Browser. It's slow, but it works sometimes.   
I'm from Russia, and yes, I can't download anything from HF either.

Comment: God bless you. Use google colab to download model from HF to colab and then download from colab to your PC. Example command for colab: !wget path/to/file.safetensors Alternate way is to use modelscope website
