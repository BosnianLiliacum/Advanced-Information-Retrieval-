# What My Project Does

I'm excited to share my latest project, a **Hexagonal Grid Text Encryption** system! This encryption method transforms a given text into a hexagonal grid, permutes it based on a key, and then converts it back to encrypted text. The system includes functions to create a hexagonal grid, permute it based on a key, convert text to and from a matrix format, and ultimately encrypt and decrypt the text.

Here’s a brief overview of the key components:

* **Hexagonal Grid Creation**: Generates a hexagonal grid pattern based on a specified size.
* **Grid Permutation**: Uses a key to permute the grid using a pseudorandom shuffle.
* **Text to Matrix Conversion**: Converts a text string to a matrix of ASCII values based on the hexagonal grid.
* **Matrix to Text Conversion**: Converts the matrix back to a text string.
* **Encryption and Decryption**: Uses the hexagonal grid and permutation to securely encrypt and decrypt text.

The code ensures the original text can be perfectly reconstructed from the encrypted text, provided the same key is used.

# Target Audience

This project is primarily intended for:

* **Cryptography Enthusiasts**: If you're interested in exploring unique and unconventional methods of data encryption, this project is for you.
* **Educational Purposes**: This project can be a great learning tool for those studying data encryption techniques, Python programming, or algorithm design.
* **Hobbyists and Developers**: While not recommended for production use due to the unconventional and possibly unproven nature of the encryption method, it's a fun project for developers to tinker with and extend.

# Comparison

Unlike traditional encryption methods like AES or RSA, which are well-studied and widely used in secure communication, this Hexagonal Grid Text Encryption system offers a novel approach by leveraging geometric patterns for data transformation. Here are some key differences:

* **Uniqueness**: This method uses a hexagonal grid for text transformation, which is not commonly seen in standard encryption algorithms.
* **Educational Value**: The project provides a hands-on way to understand and implement the concept of data permutation and transformation.
* **Not Production-Ready**: Unlike established encryption methods, this project is more of a toy project and educational tool rather than a secure encryption standard suitable for sensitive data.

Feel free to check out the code on github, and let me know what you think! Feedback and contributions are always welcome.

  Comment: Hi there, from the /r/Python mods.

We want to emphasize that while security-centric programs are fun project spaces to explore we do not recommend that they be treated as a 
security solution unless they’ve been audited by a third party, security professional and the audit is visible for review.

Security is not easy. And making project to learn how to manage it is a great idea to learn about the complexity of this world. That said, there’s a difference 
between exploring and learning about a topic space, and trusting that a product is secure for sensitive materials in the face of adversaries. 

We hope you enjoy projects like these from a safety conscious perspective. 

Warm regards and all the best for your future Pythoneering,

  Comment: Please edit your post to explain it’s a toy or a puzzle in the first sentence.

Obviously no one should use this at all, and it’s dishonest of you to post it like that.

  Comment: Hey, cool project! You really put a lot of time into polishing the code and it's really nice and easy to read.

Since this cypher is visually inspired, I think it'd be really helpful to create a visual explanation of a specific example going through the encryption and decryption process, and showing the permuted grids.

A couple thoughts:
- You convert to a matrix of ints, but as far as I can tell the values of these ints aren't used in the process and you could just leave them as the individual characters for clarity.
- A lot of your code is dealing with flattening matricies to make the index math simpler. I think you could create a simple matrix class which has a couple methods for indexing according to a flat indexing scheme, which would simplify your code.
- From a security perspective, if I'm understanding the algorithm correctly, this is in a class of encryption schemes called [transposition ciphers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher). These can be pretty fun to study! I wouldn't recommend using these types of ciphers for truly sensitive materials, as they have a number of weaknesses outlined in the Wikipedia article.
