# Backstory

*Skip this if you're busy. Scroll down to the main part.*

Hey y'all! It's been a few years since I learnt the basics of python, and then came a brief pause in my learning journey. I have coded a lot before this, in python, but never really been serious about stuff. Anyways, I recently decided to get back to it and started working on my first ever Python project.

I can't submit a GIF here somehow, so here's a sped-up [Gameplay](https://imgur.com/a/Nk7GPlK) of it.

# What My Project Does

This program is a terminal based (TUI) game, inspired by the common *lifesim* games all around (like *InstLife*, *Bitlife*, *AltLife*, etc), but in no way, close to them. A lot is basic in here, and a lot is missing. I've tried to use this project as an opportunity to test my programming skills.

The game comes with basic *lifesim* elements like:

* **Home Screen:** Where most of the gameplay takes place.
* **Profile:** The player's profile.
* **Activities tab:**  Where the player can choose to do something.
* **Relations tab:** Where the player can view their relations.
* **Career:** Where the player can look for jobs.
* **Lifestyle:** Where the player can buy different lifestyles.



# Target Audience

This is a *toy project* -- hence, the audience I'm looking for, is the one that can navigate me through understanding where I stand, what things need to be done and what's quite fine in the code.  It is just for some fun and a bit of learning for me, as well. I hope it's allowed here.



# Comparison

Being a *toy project*, this is intended to not be of much uniqueness. It is like most of the other *lifesims* out there, maybe even a watered-down version of them, rightfully so.

Although, I can count a few interesting things on the top of my head.

* It's unique in the sense that it is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) program, and hence it may appeal to those who prefer that instead of a GUI.
* The education section, the gameplay around it... I've tried to make it a bit more intuitive, although a lot is missing. 
* In comparison to various indie projects that I've seen online, specifically about *lifesims* in Python, I think I have gone into a bit of a unique direction, albeit the project is at a very humble stage to claim all that. I do have to mention, I've yet to see a fully functional TUI events log in such Python *lifesims* as of now. Maybe there is anything like that... probably? But I am quite satisfied with what I've done with that, personally.

  
It almost feels bad talking about such a trivial project, so much, but the requirements are there. I hope my code is easy on your eyes! (HAHA).

**All the necessary information, as well as the steps of installation have been described in my GitHub Repo. I would be thrilled to receive feedback from y'all.**

# In case I didn't mention it already, my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/areebnaqash/BitZoo) is here.

**Thanks!**

  Comment: The game looks really good!
I noticed you used `rich` and its renderables and I was wondering if you had given any thought to using `textual` ([docs](https://textual.textualize.io)), which is built with `rich`?
