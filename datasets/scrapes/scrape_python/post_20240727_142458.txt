  Comment: Hi guys, I am glad to be part of this community and I look forward to my journey in python with you guys.

I am a few weeks old with python and I am currently doing an online course (not sure if I am allowed to mention the name), so I was just wondering if anyone can recommend some helpful threads here for beginners
