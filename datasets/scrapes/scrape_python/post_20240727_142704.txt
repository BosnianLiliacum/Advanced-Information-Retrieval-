# What my project does

**Expedite Bridge** is a GUI client for **Expedite Service**, a simple encrypted file transfer service (that I published [about](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1dx7qqb/introducing_expedite_a_simple_encrypted_file/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) around a couple of weeks back). Written in [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/), the builds are provided for GNU/Linux distributions and Microsoft Windows. With this project, I attempt to make it easier for users where a desktop environment is available, compared to the CLI client **Expedite Prompt**.

# Attempting

If this looks exciting to you, please consider giving the project a spin using the [publicly available servers](https://github.com/gridhead/expedite?tab=readme-ov-file#offerings) and let me know how I can further improve the project by [**filing**](https://github.com/gridhead/expedite/issues) issue tickets for software errors or feature requests. [**Starring**](https://github.com/gridhead/expedite/stargazers) the project repository, [**contributing**](https://github.com/gridhead/expedite/fork) to the codebase or [**sponsoring**](https://github.com/sponsors/gridhead) me to keep working on more FOSS projects would forever be greatly appreciated! &lt;3

The binaries are built using [PyInstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) on the [GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/actions) whenever a commit is pushed to the repository. Please visit the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/gridhead/expedite/actions) of the project repository to download the builds. While the project can run on any platform supporting Python, the automated builds are available only for GNU/Linux distributions and Microsoft Windows of x86-64 architecture.

# Target Audience

This project is meant for general users...

* Those who do not have a publicly accessible IP address for their personal computers
   * Because their ISP provides them a carrier-grade network address translation service
   * Because they do not want to expose their personal computers to the open internet
* Those who do not want to use third party storage services for storing their data assets
   * Because they do not trust how the service providers might use their information
   * Because they do not want or cannot pay for the services of larger storage capacity
* Those who do not want to go through the trouble of setting up a VPN service
   * Because they do not necessarily belong to the system administration fraternity
   * Because sharing data assets is too small of a usecase for setting up a VPN

# Comparison

* **transfer.sh**
   * Positives
      * Asynchronous mode of transmission is possible up to a default time of 14 days
      * No account creation or no utility installation is required in most cases
   * Negatives
      * Requires the entire file contents to be uploaded before it can be downloaded
      * Requires large storage capacity at the server side due to data retention
* **Google Drive**
   * Positives
      * Large amount of mirrors ensures proper data content duplication and availability
      * Integration with multiple Google Workspace services and other collaborative tools
   * Negatives
      * Requires a mandatory Google account inviting invasive analytical tracking
      * Concerns regarding privacy and usage conditions of data content stored

  Comment: Hi there, from the /r/Python mods.

We want to emphasize that while security-centric programs are fun project spaces to explore we do not recommend that they be treated as a 
security solution unless they’ve been audited by a third party, security professional and the audit is visible for review.

Security is not easy. And making project to learn how to manage it is a great idea to learn about the complexity of this world. That said, there’s a difference 
between exploring and learning about a topic space, and trusting that a product is secure for sensitive materials in the face of adversaries. 

We hope you enjoy projects like these from a safety conscious perspective. 

Warm regards and all the best for your future Pythoneering,

  Comment: Are you hosting those public file transfer servers? Have you carefully thought through the legal risks of doing so?
