# What My Project Does

This inspection tool is extremely useful for debugging in dynamically typed Python. It allows you to examine unknown objects at runtime. Specifically, you can investigate **type**, **formatted value**, **variables**, **methods**, **parent types**, **signature**, **documentation**, and even the **source code**.

Let me know what you think. I would really appreciate your feedback.

  Comment: Very Nice! I will try it. Lost the opportunity to use wtf as the name of the function:

'wtf / 1'.

  Comment: Very nice! I like that it hides dunders by default. Will be useful for debugging and learning new frameworks.
