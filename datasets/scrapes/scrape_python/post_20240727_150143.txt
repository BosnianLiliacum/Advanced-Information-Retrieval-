Im having trouble finding some scapy documentation for the python module. I see a lot of examples and docs of use in linux terminal, but very little for python scripting. I know theres the built in help() function but its kind of hard to wrap my head around it. Mayby im being lazy there. Any additional resources would be appreciated 🙌
