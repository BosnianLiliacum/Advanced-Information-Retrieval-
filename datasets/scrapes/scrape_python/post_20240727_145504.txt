# What My Project Does

A more flexible [PGMQ Postgres extension](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq) Python client using **SQLAlchemy ORM**, supporting both **async** and **sync** `engines`, `sessionmakers`, or built from `dsn`.

# Comparison

* The [official PGMQ package](https://github.com/tembo-io/pgmq) only supports `psycopg3` DBAPIs.
* For most use cases, using `SQLAlchemy` ORM as the PGMQ client is more flexible, as most Python backend developers won't directly use Python Postgres DBAPIs.

# Features

* Supports **async** and **sync** `engines` and `sessionmakers`, or built from `dsn`.
* **Automatically** creates the `pgmq` (or `pg_partman`) extension on the database if it does not exist.
* Supports **all Postgres DBAPIs supported by SQLAlchemy**, e.g., `psycopg`, `psycopg2`, `asyncpg`.
   * See [SQLAlchemy Postgresql Dialects](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/postgresql.html) for all dialects.

# Target Audience

[pgmq-sqlalchemy](https://github.com/jason810496/pgmq-sqlalchemy) is a production package that can be used in scenarios that need a message queue for general fan-out systems or third-party dependencies retry mechanisms.
