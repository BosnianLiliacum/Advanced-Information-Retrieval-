Hello everyone, this is a project I've been working on from a few years for my own-use with my pets, and this year I decided to share it with the community.

**Project website:** [PuppySignal.com](https://puppysignal.com/)

**What my project does**

The functionality is pretty simple: when you log in, you create a profile for your pet, and a QR code will be generated and linked to its profile. When someone scans this code and decides to share its location, you will receive a notification on your phone with your pet's location, and the person who scanned it will see your contact information.

It consists of a few projects built with React (web and documentation), React Native (mobile), and Python for the backend (FastAPI and SQLAlchemy).

**Target audience**

Pet owners, but anyone could create codes and attach them to items, or whatever they want.

**Comparison**

Many QR pet tag alternatives already exist. The difference between them and PuppySignal is that you don't have to buy a QR tag and wait for it to be delivered. You can just clone it, self-host it, print the QR code, and attach it to your pet's collar.

  Comment: woah this is soo cool. But I do have a few doubts. like is it only for dogs if it is not the name is kind of misleading. And will it be sending your live location or a location you select. I would also like to suggest the idea of selling the tags with qr codes on them because if a person just sticks a picture of the qr code on the collar the pic will  be destroyed due to things like rain if the pet is missing for multiple days.

  Comment: This sounds like a smart tag, but with extra steps: Apple AirTags, Samsung SmartTags, Tile... Tiles? which use Bluetooth Low Energy to connect to nearby phones, and use said phones to "call home" and anonymously broadcast the tag location.

However the fact that you can get the full contract info is nice. Good project :)
