Hello Python and Open Source Enthusiasts!



I'm excited to introduce \[Lambda Forge\](https://docs.lambda-forge.com/home/getting-started/), a Python framework designed to make AWS Lambda function creation and deployment effortless. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with serverless architectures, Lambda Forge has something to offer.



---



### What My Project Does



Lambda Forge simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and managing AWS Lambda functions. It provides a robust CLI tool to generate Lambda function templates, authorizers, and service integrations with ease. The framework supports live development, allowing developers to test and debug Lambda functions locally while connected to real AWS resources. Additionally, Lambda Forge facilitates the creation and deployment of Lambda Layers, and it automatically generates documentation and architecture diagrams for your projects.

### Target Audience



Lambda Forge is designed for developers who are building serverless applications using AWS Lambda. Whether you're working on production-grade applications or experimenting with serverless technologies, Lambda Forge provides the tools and structure to streamline your development workflow. It's suitable for both experienced developers looking for efficiency and newcomers seeking an easy entry point into serverless development.

### Key Features:



\*\***1. CLI Tool:**\*\*  

Lambda Forge includes a powerful CLI tool, \`FORGE\`, to help you create and manage serverless projects efficiently.



\*\***2. Modular Functions:**\*\*  

Easily create Lambda functions with a modular architecture that adheres to best coding practices. Example command:



\`\`\`shell

forge function hello\_world --method "GET" --description "A simple hello world" --public

\`\`\`



\*\***3. Authorizers:**\*\*  

Secure your Lambda functions with structured authorizers. Example command:



\`\`\`shell

\`\`\`



\*\***4. AWS Services Integration:**\*\*  

Generate dedicated service classes for seamless interaction with AWS resources. Example command:



\`\`\`shell

forge service sns

\`\`\`



\*\***5. Lambda Layers:**\*\*  

Simplify working with Lambda Layers, including custom and external libraries. Example command:



\`\`\`shell

forge layer --custom my\_custom\_layer

\`\`\`



\*\***6. Live Development:**\*\*  

Connect Lambda functions to your local environment for hot reload and easy debugging. Example command:



\`\`\`shell

forge live server

\`\`\`

### Comparison



Lambda Forge stands out from other serverless frameworks due to its focus on ease of use and developer productivity. The CLI tool, \`FORGE\`, provides a highly intuitive interface for generating and managing serverless resources. The modular structure promotes clean code practices, and the integration with live development ensures a seamless debugging experience. Furthermore, Lambda Forge automates documentation and architecture diagram generation, saving developers time and effort. Its emphasis on single responsibility principles and dependency injection sets it apart from existing alternatives, offering a more structured and maintainable approach to serverless development.
